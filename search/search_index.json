Child protection prevention and response mechanisms responses must be established from the start of an intervention, or children's lives and well-being will be put at risk. The most important outcomes of child protection are to prevent violence, abuse and exploitation, and to ensure all children access to protection services, by establishing or supporting national and community-level child protection systems. _This policy details our Foundation's commitment to Child protection. _ Definitions \u00b6 GE / the Foundation Grassroots Economics, a registered Foundation. Child Persons who are under 18 years of age UASC Unaccompanied and separated children WFCL Worst forms of child labour e.g. illicit work, work that harms their health, safety or morals Discrimination Treating an individual and/or group of people less well because of whom or what they are. CRC Convention for Rights of the Child BIP Best Interest Procedures BIA Best Interest Assessment SOP Standard Operation Procedures Protection Objectives \u00b6 Priority objectives during the first phase of an intervention: To ensure that girls and boys are safe where they live, learn and play. To strengthen the capacity of children to participate in their own protection. To give girls and boys child-friendly access to asylum, refugee and other legal procedures, and to essential documents. To ensure that girls and boys with specific needs receive targeted support. Guiding Principles Best interest of the child For all decisions related to a child, the best interest of this child should be considered first and foremost. Each child\u2019s best interest should be considered as an individual Non-discrimination All children are equally entitled to all of the rights in the convention. No child should be discriminated on the basis of gender, age, ethnicity, race, religion, physical abilities, etc Participation Children are no longer considered just property of their parents; nor are they passive recipients of charity. Children are active rights claimants. Children have the right to participate in the decisions that affect their lives. Survival and Development Children\u2019s mental, emotional and physical development are interlinked. All rights of children must be realized. Standards and Frameworks The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Sphere, Minimum Standards for Child Protection in Humanitarian Action , and its core principles and standards for child protection work (see the diagram below). Rights-based approaches, including age, gender, and diversity mainstreaming (AGD). The InterAgency Guiding Principles on Unaccompanied and Separated Children \ufeff The Children Act (2012) of Kenya These principles provide definitions and key standards and principles for preventing and responding to family separation, and on working with unaccompanied and separated children. We fully suport the Standards for Child Protection in Humanitarian Action Risks Affecting Children Lack of access to asylum procedures or procedures that are child-friendly. If asylum processes are not child sensitive, children may not be able to exercise their right to seek asylum, or may be put in a position where they are easily exploited by adults. Separation from parents and caregivers. Children can become separated from their parents and caregivers before or during flight or while in displacement. They can be sent away, abandoned, or encouraged to live alone (because, for example, their carers believe they will receive more support). UASC are often particularly at risk of violence, exploitation, abuse or neglect. Sexual violence and sexual exploitation. Displaced children are particularly at risk of sexual violence and exploitation. A high proportion of survivors of sexual violence are girls, but boys are also affected. Mental disorders and psychosocial distress. In contexts of forced displacement, children are exposed to traumatic events as well as high levels of daily stress. Without adequate support, many are likely to develop health issues. Children associated with armed forces and armed groups. Refugee and displaced children, especially adolescents who are not in school, may be recruited by armed forces and armed groups. Such children are often exposed to extreme violence and may be abused, exploited, injured or killed. Trafficking, smuggling, sale and illegal adoption, inappropriate adoption. Displaced children may be targeted for trafficking, smuggling, sale and illegal adoption. UASC are particularly at risk. Physical violence and harmful practices. In displacement, children are at increased risk of domestic violence, abuse and corporal punishment, because their families are under acute strain and community protection mechanisms are disrupted. In their efforts to cope, families may adopt harmful practices, and children may adopt negative coping mechanisms, including substance abuse. Child labour. When families lose their income and assets, children are more likely to become involved in the worst forms of child labour (WFCL), such as forced or bonded labour. Children may be used in armed conflicts, trafficked for exploitative work or sexual exploitation, engaged in illicit work, or forced to do work that is likely to harm their health, safety or morals. Dangers and injuries. Children living in insecure or unsafe conditions are at greater risk of injury and disability. When they are in, or travel through, conflict zones, for example, they risk injury from unexploded ordnance and landmines. Detention. Particularly in the context of political conflicts, children who participate in political activities (or are perceived to have participated in them) are commonly detained. Children seeking asylum may also be detained. Especially when they are held in facilities alongside adults, children in detention are at risk of psychological, physical and sexual abuse and other harms to their development. Best Practices in Policy and Decision making When discussing either the Best Interest of the Child or the Welfare Principle emphasis must be placed on three main applications: Government policy making (Government Decisions), Program design (Programming Decisions) and Decisions made about children on an individual basis (Individual Decisions). The Best Interest of a Child relates to our DECISION MAKING process with regards to children\u2019s rights, well-being, positive development, protection and children\u2019s wishes. Policy Decisions International Humanitarian Organizations and the Kenya Children Act (2012) requires projects to analyze how each course of action may affect children. Because the interests of children are not always identical to adults' interests, and can at times even conflict, GE must carefully separate out the various interests at stake. The government does not have to take the course of action that is best for children, but if any conflicts are identified, GE must make the \" best interests \" of children \" a primary consideration .\" This rule applies in budget allocations, in the making of laws, and in the administration of the government. Program Decisions: Similar to how the government must create policies for the protection of all children in the state, organizations designing programs or making programming decisions on behalf of all children in a program location must do so considering how the rights, well-being, positive development, protection and children\u2019s wishes will be affected on a broad scale. Therefore, rather than look at an individual child, organizations will assess a given population and design programs that will benefit this entire population. For example, an organization may design an awareness raising campaign on the reintegration of former child soldiers. The program itself is not targeting any one child, but intends to bring awareness to support all former child soldiers. Participants should understand that the design of their activities can have an impact on an individual child or groups of children depending on how the activity is planned and implemented. In addition, how they respond (identify, report, refer, followup) to child protection cases must be carefully thought through on the basis of the Best Interest of the Child with careful evaluation to ensure that decisions are not solely made in the interest of the parent, the agency responding, or sometimes even the child\u2019s own wishes. Procedure to ensure non-discrimination The Human Rights committee defines discrimination as any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference which is based on any ground such as race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status and which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by all persons, on an equal footing of all rights and freedoms. According to the CRC, Article 2 states that, \u2015States shall respect and ensure the rights set forth in the present convention to each child within their jurisdiction without discrimination of any kind, irrespective of the child\u2019s or his or her parents or legal guardian\u2019s race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national, ethnic or social origin, property, disability, birth and status. In other words, every child within a State\u2019s jurisdiction holds all CRC rights without regard to citizenship, immigration status or any other status. Refugee children, asylum seekers, and rejected asylum seekers are entitled to all rights of the CRC. States parties should take all appropriate measures to ensure that a child is protected against all forms of discrimination or punishment on the basis of status, activities, expressed opinions or beliefs of a child\u2019s guardians or family members. Program design for Child Protection Are there Groups of boys and girls discriminated against: (Question: Who is discriminated against?) Children with disabilities Child Soldiers Children affected by HIV/AIDS Street Children Working Children Orphans Reasons for Discrimination: (Question: Why are they being discriminated against?) Poverty and other economic reasons Traditional/Cultural beliefs and practices Lack of education Lack of awareness Family environment Sex Discrimination Behavior: (Question: What is the result of the discrimination?) Limited opportunities (limited access to education) Limited scope of participation Inheritance law Abuse Family values boys over girls The program should ensure that the above are taken into consideration and that no child is discriminated against in the intervention.It is vital that protection of children is prioritised. These should determine programme design, alongside factors such as the number of children at risk, and assistance and protection services that are already operational. It is important to continuously monitor and analyse the nature and scale of risks to children, the capacity of populations of concern and the child protection system to address those risks. Key Steps in Child Protection Analyse child protection needs and capacities and plan the response Assess child protection needs and risks and prioritise them in terms of severity and scale. Base initial assessments on pre-crisis and secondary data, and that risks for children are prevalent even if there is no data to substantiate this. Consider what further information is needed. This can be collected by including child protection questions and issues in initial rapid needs assessments (within 1 \u2013 3 weeks), or specifically assessing child protection concerns (within 4-6 weeks, ongoing as required). Assess the capacity of the child protection system, of GE, partners, and other key actors. Look for ways to connect with and build on existing capacity. Monitor and report on child protection issues and violations. There is a specific obligation to monitor and report on grave violations against children. Identify gaps in GE capacity and the need for dedicated child protection staff. Review the percentage of children in the population and the severity of the child protection risks. Consider asking GE to deploy additional child protection personnel and provide expert guidance. Establish or strengthen coordination mechanisms for child protection. To start with, focus on technical and strategic guidance, identifying gaps, and ensuring that services are not duplicated. Develop a capacity building strategy for volunteers, partners, Government and different categories of GE staff. GE is often able to support capacity building technically. Consider coaching, mentoring, self-learning, and other methods in addition to training, and tie training to performance outcomes. Establish mechanisms to identify, prioritise, assess and refer children at risk At registration Include clear guidelines and screening questionsin the registration procedures that will identify vulnerable children. Assign child protection staff to registration points and establish a child protection desk. Establish referral pathways and criteria for prioritizing identified children at risk. Prioritization should be based on an evaluation of exposure to risk, and referral pathways should be part of the operation's best interests procedure for children at risk. As soon as possible, train registration and other key staff to identify and refer children at risk, and in how to communicate with children. Ensure registration environments and processes are child-friendly, including providing communication material and information that are accessible to children of different ages and abilities. At camp / site / city level Set up a functioning best interests procedure (BIP) and ensure that enough GE and partner staff are available for implementation. Agree on prioritisation criteria, referral pathways, and BIP Standard Operating Procedures (i.e. SOPs for case management) of children at risk. As part of the BIP, establish clear roles, responsibilities and mechanisms to ensure that Best Interest Assessments (BIAs) are systematically conducted for UASC and other children at risk. Information recorded in relation to cases of individual children at risk should be stored securely and confidentially using the Child Protection Module in proGres V4 wherever this is in use. The Child Protection Information Management System or other systems may be used by some partners, in which case GE will need to find ways to share information appropriately. Ensure that asylum and assistance procedures are child-friendly, for example by consulting children on GE and partner procedures and integrating their feedback, and providing information to children in a format that they can understand. 3. Prevent, and respond to, separation of children from parents and caregivers Put in place measures to prevent separation during arrival, relocation and evacuations. (Ensure families are kept together, do not transfer children alone without screening first, etc.) Ensure that assistance procedures do not encourage deliberate separation (for example by targeting UASC, or encouraging families to split in order to receive additional assistance). Ensure that mechanisms are in place to identify, refer, document, trace and reunify children. Coordinate with ICRC and national Red Cross/Crescent Societies. Support or establish tracing activities (community-based tracing mechanisms, listening posts, children's desks, phone calls, progress searches, etc.), as necessary. Ensure that Best Interests Procedure is in place for all children who require tracing and reunification. (See the Entry on Best Interests Procedures \ufeff.) 4. Ensure adequate alternative care services Seek to understand traditional care strategies for UASC (including potential protection risks linked to these). Assess the capacity of the community to absorb children that need care, and the complementary support that is potentially required.Complementary support be based on the family's vulnerability rather than the fact that the family is caring for UASC, so as to prevent deliberate separation in the hope of assistance. Conduct BIA for all children who are considered for, or who are in, alternative care. If numbers are high, prioritize younger children and unaccompanied children. Identify a range of alternative care options for children in different situations. Prioritize younger children for family-based care, and keep siblings together. Options are likely to include foster care, and supported/supervised independent living for older children or child-headed households, for whom family-based care has been explored and proven to be unfeasible. Residential care arrangements in family-like settings may be considered if the community's foster-care capacity is overwhelmed. Institutional care should be a last resort and for the shortest possible time. Mobilize community leaders and community-based organizations (such as foster parents' associations) to support alternative care. 5. Provide psychosocial support for children, parents and caregivers Provide parents and caregivers with information on child psychosocial distress, and on how they can support their children to recover, as well as access services. Establish regular structured recreational activities, led by community volunteers, and coordinate these with education activities. This may include child friendly spaces, ensuring that age and gender-sensitive activities are developed and implemented for teenagers. Ensure that psychosocial support activities link to and support safe emergency education of good quality. Work with other sectors to ensure that they consider the protection and wellbeing of children. Assist them to make their services child-friendly and accessible. 6. Prevent and respond to sexual violence and exploitation Ensure that measures to prevent sexual violence and sexual exploitation include children (for example, by identifying risk factors specific to children). Ensure that response and referral mechanisms are adapted to the needs of children and link to Best Interests Procedure (including, but not limited to, alternative care, BIP) where necessary. Provide information on access to services and child protection. Make information child-friendly. Access to information helps to prevent sexual exploitation. Put in place immediate safety and security measures. These include policing and emergency lighting at displacement sites, and screening procedures at points of entry to and departure from affected areas, to prevent abductions, trafficking and violence, and accommodating child-headed households close to vetted community households. 7. Strengthen community-based child protection mechanisms and national child protection system Identify community-based mechanisms, traditions and practices that contribute to the protection of children. Identify, training and mobilise resource people who can identify and refer protection risks and children at risk. Promote community-led initiatives to strengthen the protective environment (awareness-raising, referrals, follow-up of children at risk, etc.). Map the structure, capacity and procedures of the national child protection system, degree to which children of concern to GE have access to these, and support needs. Work with national authorities and UNICEF at the national level and the field to strengthen capacity, quality and responsiveness of the national system, and advocate to ensure children of concern have non-dissimilatory access. 8. Prevent recruitment and support the release and reintegration of children associated with armed forces and armed groups (CAAFAG) Ensure screening and identification procedures are in place for CAAFAG and that procedures for ex-combatants are child-sensitive. Do not detain children unless absolutely necessary. If detention is unavoidable, detain children separately, and avoid separating siblings. As a prevention and response strategy in all contexts, ensure that children have access to psychosocial, educational, livelihood and recreational activities that are not stigmatizing.","title":"Child Protection Policy"},{"location":"commons/child_policy/#grassroots-economics-foundations-child-protection-policy-and-proceedures","text":"Note about this policy template: Grassroots Economic Foundation recognizes child protection is a life-saving priority.

Displaced children may be targeted for trafficking, smuggling, sale and illegal adoption. UASC are particularly at risk. Physical violence and harmful practices. In displacement, children are at increased risk of domestic violence, abuse and corporal punishment, because their families are under acute strain and community protection mechanisms are disrupted. In their efforts to cope, families may adopt harmful practices, and children may adopt negative coping mechanisms, including substance abuse. Child labour. When families lose their income and assets, children are more likely to become involved in the worst forms of child labour (WFCL), such as forced or bonded labour. Children may be used in armed conflicts, trafficked for exploitative work or sexual exploitation, engaged in illicit work, or forced to do work that is likely to harm their health, safety or morals. Dangers and injuries. Children living in insecure or unsafe conditions are at greater risk of injury and disability. When they are in, or travel through, conflict zones, for example, they risk injury from unexploded ordnance and landmines. Detention. Particularly in the context of political conflicts, children who participate in political activities (or are perceived to have participated in them) are commonly detained. Children seeking asylum may also be detained. Especially when they are held in facilities alongside adults, children in detention are at risk of psychological, physical and sexual abuse and other harms to their development. Best Practices in Policy and Decision making When discussing either the Best Interest of the Child or the Welfare Principle emphasis must be placed on three main applications: Government policy making (Government Decisions), Program design (Programming Decisions) and Decisions made about children on an individual basis (Individual Decisions). The Best Interest of a Child relates to our DECISION MAKING process with regards to children\u2019s rights, well-being, positive development, protection and children\u2019s wishes. Policy Decisions International Humanitarian Organizations and the Kenya Children Act (2012) requires projects to analyze how each course of action may affect children. Because the interests of children are not always identical to adults' interests, and can at times even conflict, GE must carefully separate out the various interests at stake. The government does not have to take the course of action that is best for children, but if any conflicts are identified, GE must make the \" best interests \" of children \" a primary consideration .\" This rule applies in budget allocations, in the making of laws, and in the administration of the government. Program Decisions: Similar to how the government must create policies for the protection of all children in the state, organizations designing programs or making programming decisions on behalf of all children in a program location must do so considering how the rights, well-being, positive development, protection and children\u2019s wishes will be affected on a broad scale. Therefore, rather than look at an individual child, organizations will assess a given population and design programs that will benefit this entire population. For example, an organization may design an awareness raising campaign on the reintegration of former child soldiers. The program itself is not targeting any one child, but intends to bring awareness to support all former child soldiers. Participants should understand that the design of their activities can have an impact on an individual child or groups of children depending on how the activity is planned and implemented. In addition, how they respond (identify, report, refer, followup) to child protection cases must be carefully thought through on the basis of the Best Interest of the Child with careful evaluation to ensure that decisions are not solely made in the interest of the parent, the agency responding, or sometimes even the child\u2019s own wishes. Procedure to ensure non-discrimination The Human Rights committee defines discrimination as any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference which is based on any ground such as race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status and which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by all persons, on an equal footing of all rights and freedoms. According to the CRC, Article 2 states that, \u2015States shall respect and ensure the rights set forth in the present convention to each child within their jurisdiction without discrimination of any kind, irrespective of the child\u2019s or his or her parents or legal guardian\u2019s race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national, ethnic or social origin, property, disability, birth and status. In other words, every child within a State\u2019s jurisdiction holds all CRC rights without regard to citizenship, immigration status or any other status. Refugee children, asylum seekers, and rejected asylum seekers are entitled to all rights of the CRC. States parties should take all appropriate measures to ensure that a child is protected against all forms of discrimination or punishment on the basis of status, activities, expressed opinions or beliefs of a child\u2019s guardians or family members. Program design for Child Protection Are there Groups of boys and girls discriminated against: (Question: Who is discriminated against?) Children with disabilities Child Soldiers Children affected by HIV/AIDS Street Children Working Children Orphans Reasons for Discrimination: (Question: Why are they being discriminated against?) Poverty and other economic reasons Traditional/Cultural beliefs and practices Lack of education Lack of awareness Family environment Sex Discrimination Behavior: (Question: What is the result of the discrimination?) Limited opportunities (limited access to education) Limited scope of participation Inheritance law Abuse Family values boys over girls The program should ensure that the above are taken into consideration and that no child is discriminated against in the intervention.It is vital that protection of children is prioritised. These should determine programme design, alongside factors such as the number of children at risk, and assistance and protection services that are already operational. It is important to continuously monitor and analyse the nature and scale of risks to children, the capacity of populations of concern and the child protection system to address those risks. Key Steps in Child Protection Analyse child protection needs and capacities and plan the response Assess child protection needs and risks and prioritise them in terms of severity and scale. Base initial assessments on pre-crisis and secondary data, and that risks for children are prevalent even if there is no data to substantiate this. Consider what further information is needed. This can be collected by including child protection questions and issues in initial rapid needs assessments (within 1 \u2013 3 weeks), or specifically assessing child protection concerns (within 4-6 weeks, ongoing as required). Assess the capacity of the child protection system, of GE, partners, and other key actors. Look for ways to connect with and build on existing capacity. Monitor and report on child protection issues and violations. There is a specific obligation to monitor and report on grave violations against children. Identify gaps in GE capacity and the need for dedicated child protection staff. Review the percentage of children in the population and the severity of the child protection risks. Consider asking GE to deploy additional child protection personnel and provide expert guidance. Establish or strengthen coordination mechanisms for child protection. To start with, focus on technical and strategic guidance, identifying gaps, and ensuring that services are not duplicated. Develop a capacity building strategy for volunteers, partners, Government and different categories of GE staff. GE is often able to support capacity building technically. Consider coaching, mentoring, self-learning, and other methods in addition to training, and tie training to performance outcomes. Establish mechanisms to identify, prioritise, assess and refer children at risk At registration Include clear guidelines and screening questionsin the registration procedures that will identify vulnerable children. Assign child protection staff to registration points and establish a child protection desk. Establish referral pathways and criteria for prioritizing identified children at risk. Prioritization should be based on an evaluation of exposure to risk, and referral pathways should be part of the operation's best interests procedure for children at risk. As soon as possible, train registration and other key staff to identify and refer children at risk, and in how to communicate with children. Ensure registration environments and processes are child-friendly, including providing communication material and information that are accessible to children of different ages and abilities. At camp / site / city level Set up a functioning best interests procedure (BIP) and ensure that enough GE and partner staff are available for implementation. Agree on prioritisation criteria, referral pathways, and BIP Standard Operating Procedures (i.e. SOPs for case management) of children at risk. As part of the BIP, establish clear roles, responsibilities and mechanisms to ensure that Best Interest Assessments (BIAs) are systematically conducted for UASC and other children at risk. Information recorded in relation to cases of individual children at risk should be stored securely and confidentially using the Child Protection Module in proGres V4 wherever this is in use. The Child Protection Information Management System or other systems may be used by some partners, in which case GE will need to find ways to share information appropriately. Ensure that asylum and assistance procedures are child-friendly, for example by consulting children on GE and partner procedures and integrating their feedback, and providing information to children in a format that they can understand. 3. Prevent, and respond to, separation of children from parents and caregivers Put in place measures to prevent separation during arrival, relocation and evacuations. (Ensure families are kept together, do not transfer children alone without screening first, etc.) Ensure that assistance procedures do not encourage deliberate separation (for example by targeting UASC, or encouraging families to split in order to receive additional assistance). Ensure that mechanisms are in place to identify, refer, document, trace and reunify children. Coordinate with ICRC and national Red Cross/Crescent Societies. Support or establish tracing activities (community-based tracing mechanisms, listening posts, children's desks, phone calls, progress searches, etc.), as necessary. Ensure that Best Interests Procedure is in place for all children who require tracing and reunification. (See the Entry on Best Interests Procedures \ufeff.) 4. Ensure adequate alternative care services Seek to understand traditional care strategies for UASC (including potential protection risks linked to these). Assess the capacity of the community to absorb children that need care, and the complementary support that is potentially required.Complementary support be based on the family's vulnerability rather than the fact that the family is caring for UASC, so as to prevent deliberate separation in the hope of assistance. Conduct BIA for all children who are considered for, or who are in, alternative care. If numbers are high, prioritize younger children and unaccompanied children. Identify a range of alternative care options for children in different situations. Prioritize younger children for family-based care, and keep siblings together. Options are likely to include foster care, and supported/supervised independent living for older children or child-headed households, for whom family-based care has been explored and proven to be unfeasible. Residential care arrangements in family-like settings may be considered if the community's foster-care capacity is overwhelmed. Institutional care should be a last resort and for the shortest possible time. Mobilize community leaders and community-based organizations (such as foster parents' associations) to support alternative care. 5. Provide psychosocial support for children, parents and caregivers Provide parents and caregivers with information on child psychosocial distress, and on how they can support their children to recover, as well as access services. Establish regular structured recreational activities, led by community volunteers, and coordinate these with education activities. This may include child friendly spaces, ensuring that age and gender-sensitive activities are developed and implemented for teenagers. Ensure that psychosocial support activities link to and support safe emergency education of good quality. Work with other sectors to ensure that they consider the protection and wellbeing of children. Assist them to make their services child-friendly and accessible. 6. Prevent and respond to sexual violence and exploitation Ensure that measures to prevent sexual violence and sexual exploitation include children (for example, by identifying risk factors specific to children). Ensure that response and referral mechanisms are adapted to the needs of children and link to Best Interests Procedure (including, but not limited to, alternative care, BIP) where necessary. Provide information on access to services and child protection. Make information child-friendly. Access to information helps to prevent sexual exploitation. Put in place immediate safety and security measures. These include policing and emergency lighting at displacement sites, and screening procedures at points of entry to and departure from affected areas, to prevent abductions, trafficking and violence, and accommodating child-headed households close to vetted community households. 7. Strengthen community-based child protection mechanisms and national child protection system Identify community-based mechanisms, traditions and practices that contribute to the protection of children. Identify, training and mobilise resource people who can identify and refer protection risks and children at risk. Promote community-led initiatives to strengthen the protective environment (awareness-raising, referrals, follow-up of children at risk, etc.). Map the structure, capacity and procedures of the national child protection system, degree to which children of concern to GE have access to these, and support needs. Work with national authorities and UNICEF at the national level and the field to strengthen capacity, quality and responsiveness of the national system, and advocate to ensure children of concern have non-dissimilatory access. 8. Prevent recruitment and support the release and reintegration of children associated with armed forces and armed groups (CAAFAG) Ensure screening and identification procedures are in place for CAAFAG and that procedures for ex-combatants are child-sensitive. Do not detain children unless absolutely necessary. If detention is unavoidable, detain children separately, and avoid separating siblings. As a prevention and response strategy in all contexts, ensure that children have access to psychosocial, educational, livelihood and recreational activities that are not stigmatizing.","title":"Protection Objectives"},{"location":"commons/data_policy/","text":"Grassroots Economics Foundation's Data Protection Policy \u00b6 Note about this policy: Protecting individuals\u2019 Personal Data is an integral part of protecting their life, integrity and dignity. The right to privacy has long been recognized globally as a human right, while the right to Personal Data protection is a relatively recent human right that is closely connected to the right to privacy and sets forth conditions for the Processing of data of an identified or identifiable individual. This is why Personal Data protection is of fundamental importance for Humanitarian Organizations like us. This policy details our Foundations commitment to Data protection and privacy. Grassroots Economics recognizes and does comply with GDPR and its rights, except as limited. We make it as easy as possible to exercise most rights directly from your account. Users may contact us at privacy@grassecon.org to exercise their GDPR rights. Definitions \u00b6 GE / the Foundation Grassroots Economics Foundation, a registered non-profit GDPR The General Data Protection Regulation Responsible Person GE HR department Register of Systems GE IT Department PII Personal Identifying Information 1. Data protection principles \u00b6 The Foundation is committed to processing data in accordance with its responsibilities under the GDPR. Article 5 of the GDPR requires that personal data shall be processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to individuals; collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes shall not be considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes; adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed; accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay; kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational measures required by the GDPR in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of individuals; and processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage,using appropriate technical or organisational measures.\u201d 2. General provisions \u00b6 This policy applies to all personal data processed by the Foundation. The Responsible Person shall take responsibility for the Foundation\u2019s ongoing compliance with this policy. This policy shall be reviewed at least annually. The Foundation shall adhere to the Data Protection Act of 2019 which was assented to by the President of the Republic of Kenya on 08 November 2019 (the \"Act\" ). The Foundation will ensure to have all the appropriate licenses/permits required for the handling of personal information The Foundation shall ensure all staff have read and signed the Data Protection & Privacy policy The Foundation will ensure that in the case of personal data being shared to external parties; that they are informed and instructed on adequate methods of Data Handling to ensure safety and dignity of individuals. In the case of Humanitarian aid ie. cash transfers being dependent on data collection; It would therefore not be necessary to inform all individuals of the conditions of data collection prior to receiving aid, if this would seriously hamper, delay or prevent the distribution of aid. Rather, the Humanitarian Organizations involved could provide such information in a less targeted and individualized way with public notices, or individually at a later stage. 3. Lawful, fair and transparent processing \u00b6 To ensure its processing of data is lawful, fair and transparent, the Foundation shall maintain a Register of Systems. The Register of Systems shall be reviewed at least annually. Individuals have the right to access their personal data and any such requests made to the foundation shall be dealt with in a timely manner. The Foundation shall always inform the individuals whose PII data is being shared. 4. Lawful purposes \u00b6 All data processed by the foundation must be done on one of the following lawful bases: consent, contract, legal obligation, vital interests, public task or legitimate interests ( see Kenya Data Protection Act Guideline ). The Foundation shall note the appropriate lawful basis in the Register of Systems. Where consent is relied upon as a lawful basis for processing data, evidence of opt-in consent shall be kept with the personal data. Where communications are sent to individuals based on their consent, the option for the individual to revoke their consent should be clearly available and systems should be in place to ensure such revocation is reflected accurately in the Foundation\u2019s systems. 5. Data minimisation \u00b6 The Foundation shall ensure that personal data are adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed. 6. Sensitive Data \u00b6 Sensitive Data means Personal Data (aka Personal Identifying Information (PII)), which if disclosed, may result in discrimination or violence against or the repression of an individual. Typically, data relating to health, race or ethnicity, religious/political/armed group affiliation, or genetic and biometric data are considered to be Sensitive Data. All Sensitive Data requires augmented protection. Given the environments in which Humanitarian Organizations work and the possibility that various data elements that we handle may give rise to discrimination, setting out a definitive list of Sensitive Data categories. For example, in some situations, a simple list of names may be very sensitive, if it puts the individuals on the list and/or their families at risk of persecution. Equally, in other situations, data collected to respond to Humanitarian Emergencies may need to include data that in a regular data protection context would be considered to be Sensitive Data and the Processing of such data would be, in principle, prohibited, but in the local culture and the specific circumstances may be relatively harmless. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the sensitivity of data and the appropriate safeguards to protect Sensitive Data (e.g. technical and organizational security measures) on a case-by-case basis. 7. Accuracy \u00b6 The Foundation shall take reasonable steps to ensure personal data is accurate. Note that the majority of PII data is user generated and optional. Where necessary for the lawful basis on which data is processed, steps shall be put in place to ensure that personal data is kept up to date. Data shall be collected in accordance with the Handbook on Data Protection and Humanitarian Action by ICRC 8. Archiving / removal \u00b6 To ensure that personal data is kept for no longer than necessary, the Foundation shall put in place an archiving policy for each area in which personal data is processed and review this process annually. The archiving policy shall consider what data should/must be retained, for how long, and why. (Various partners require records for 10 years) 9. Security \u00b6 The Foundation shall ensure that personal data is stored securely using modern software that is kept-up-to-date. An annual security audit should be carried out to test the Register of Systems integrity Access to personal data shall be limited to personnel who need access and appropriate security should be in place to avoid unauthorised sharing of information. When personal data is deleted this should be done safely such that the data is irrecoverable. Appropriate back-up and disaster recovery solutions shall be in place. 10. Breach \u00b6 In the event of a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data, the Foundation shall promptly assess the risk to people\u2019s rights and freedoms and if appropriate report this breach to the appropriate parties. 11. Training \u00b6 Regular staff training will be conducted to ensure individuals are sensitive to the latest Data Protection legislation and are aware of sensitive data, its collection and processing. 12. Data Stored and Classifications \u00b6 The following data are stored by the Foundation. Note that data that contitutes non-public identifying information (non-PII) as well as information users have chosen to share publicaly is considered non-confidential. Data Type Description Classification Instrument Data Mandatory All public information about the details and obligations associated with Instruments such as Vouchers. E.g. This is to ensure that anyone can look-up who issued a Voucher and how it can be redeemed as payment. This may include contact information and endorsments for a business or community group issuing a Voucher. Non-Confidential Phone Number Mandatory Phone Number for Account (USSD) Access Confidential Pin / Password Mandatory Needed for account access Confidential Public Key Mandatory Anonymous ledger account code Non-Confidential Private Key Mandatory Ledger account key needed for Account (USSD) Access Confidential Transaction Histories Mandatory Ledger Information (non-PII) referencing only Public Key for all registered Instruments utilized by Members Non-Confidential Agreements /Contracts Mandatory Signed agreements for groups issuing their own Instruments.

Sharing of Non-Confidential Data \u00b6 Non-Pii (Non-Confidential) Data (see example ) is shared with researchers via the UK Data Archive , a formal interface with ORCID integration which is Social-science and demographics focused. It is professionally administered by University of Essex on behalf of e.g. UK Census with the following stipulations: \u201cOpen data\u201d CC-BY-NC-SA, allows non-commercial and \u201copen\u201d use only \u201cSafeguarded data\u201d -- research only, access granted on a standardized basis UKDA is granted authority to administer data on GE\u2019s behalf Access is automatically limited to \u201cregistered users\u201d Researchers must give name, address, legal affiliation, and more. Must agree to to follow the licenses on data files, on threat of losing access and/or legal action UKDATA \u201c End User License \u201d Prohibits attempting to identify people in the data Prohibits commercial use unless granted permission Requires the data be stored safely (behind a password) Requires any derivative datasets also be deposited i.e. network repositories could only _link to _the data Requires anyone publishing from the data to report this There are ways to make it more complicated up to, like, requiring trainings END OF POLICY APPENDIX \u00b6 Data Protection checklist for Data collection from ICRC Handbook Is there Processing of Personal Data?

Preamble: \u00b6 In the spirit of knowledge sharing, the Public Awareness & Transparent Heritage (PATH) License aims to encourage transparency, equity, and community-centered practices in the distribution and exchange of all offerings, be they tangible goods, services, software, or intangible assets. By adhering to this license, entities affirm their commitment to public awareness and uphold the ideals of a transparent heritage. Many licenses are crafted to restrict your ability to share and adapt what is offered. In contrast, the PATH License aims to ensure your freedom to share, adapt, and understand all versions of an offering, ensuring it remains accessible and transparent for all its recipients. This can apply to many types of offerings including software but also with respect to food. e.g. The Recipent of tomatoes (an offering) using this license would have the right to full disclosure from the Provider on the origin, farming practices and variety of tomatoes - as as well have the right to use it in a recipe for pizza and offer pizza under the same license - again giving Full Disclosure to any following Recipients. When we mention \"free\" in the context of this license, we refer to freedom of use and understanding, not cost. The PATH License ensures that you can distribute offerings (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive Full Disclosure about the offering, and that you can adapt or use parts of it in new offerings, knowing you have the rights to do so. Providers using the PATH License safeguard your rights by: (1) asserting rights over the offering, and (2) granting you this License, which provides legal permission to reproduce, copy, distribute, and/or modify the offering. A notable advantage of this approach is that enhancements made in alternate versions of an offering, if they gain traction, become available for other providers to integrate. Many providers are motivated by the resulting collaboration. However, for offerings like software used on network servers, this collaborative spirit might not always manifest. The PATH License ensures that in such scenarios, any modifications made are transparently available to the community. It mandates that operators of such offerings provide Comprehensive Insight into any modified version being used. The PATH License is inspired by previous licenses that aimed to achieve similar transparency and community-focused goals such as AGPL3.0. The specific terms and conditions for copying, distribution, and modification are detailed in the following sections. Terms and Conditions \u00b6 Definitions : \"Offering\" encompasses any goods, services, software, intangible assets, or other entities that are sold, given, exchanged, or to which access is granted. The \"Offering\" itself is akin to the final product or service that recipients interact with, similar to an food product or the binary or executable form of a software program. \"Provider\" refers to any distributor, reseller, or entity that offers access to an offering, or any derivative or modified version of it. \"Recipient\" denotes any individual, group, or entity that receives, acquires, or is granted access to the offering, whether through purchase, exchange, gift, or any other means. \"Convey\" an offering means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a Recipient with no offering being accepted, is not conveying. \"Comprehensive Insight\" for an offering refers to the detailed information, documentation, and resources that provide a holistic understanding of the offering, enabling modifications or adaptations. This includes Primary and System Componets, Standard Interfaces and Corresponding Insights. \"Primary Component\" in this context refers to a fundamental element or feature of the specific environment or platform in which the offering operates or is utilized. \"System Components\" of an offering encompass any elements, other than the offering as a whole, that (a) are typically included when packaging a Primary Component but are not part of that Primary Component, and (b) solely facilitate the use of the offering with that Primary Component or implement a Standard Interface for which Comprehensive Insight is publicly accessible. \"Standard Interface\" denotes an interface or method of interaction that is either an established standard defined by a recognized body or, in the context of specific offerings, one that is widely accepted and utilized within that domain. \"Corresponding Insight\" for an offering encompasses all the comprehensive insight required to understand, adapt, and utilize the offering and to make modifications to it. This includes any tools, methods, or scripts integral to these activities. However, it excludes the offering's System Components or any general-purpose tools or universally accessible free methods used unaltered in these activities but not intrinsic to the offering. For instance, Corresponding Insight would include definitions, specifications, or any other essential details linked with the offering, and the comprehensive insight for interconnected components that the offering is explicitly designed to work with. The Corresponding Insight doesn't need to cover elements that recipients can easily derive or reproduce from other parts of the Corresponding Insight. For an offering in its Comprehensive Insight form, the Corresponding Insight is the offering itself. The Tomato Example Imagine a unique variety of tomato being offered in a market. This tomato, let's call it the \"SunBlush Tomato,\" is not just any ordinary tomato; it has been cultivated using specific techniques, resulting in a distinct flavor profile and nutritional benefits. The Offering: The \"SunBlush Tomato\" itself, which consumers can buy, taste, and use in their dishes, represents the \"Offering.\" It's the tangible product that recipients interact with. Corresponding Insight: To truly understand and replicate the SunBlush Tomato, one would need its: The specific seed variety or genetic makeup of the SunBlush Tomato. The soil composition and farming techniques that were used to cultivate it. The unique harvesting and storage methods that ensure its distinct flavor and freshness. Recipes or culinary techniques that best showcase its unique properties. Standard Interface: In the context of our tomato, a \"Standard Interface\" might refer to common methods of tomato cultivation or standard culinary techniques used in preparing tomatoes. System Components: These could be the general farming tools used in the cultivation of many crops, not just the SunBlush Tomato. For instance, standard watering systems, generic fertilizers, or common storage bins that aren't unique to the SunBlush Tomato's cultivation process. Primary Component: In this example, the \"Primary Component\" could be the specific greenhouse environment or the particular soil bed where the SunBlush Tomato is grown, which plays a crucial role in its unique characteristics. When someone buys the SunBlush Tomato, they get the \"Offering.\" But if they wish to understand its uniqueness, cultivate it themselves, or explore its full potential in culinary applications, they would need the \"Comprehensive Insight.\" Under the PATH License, if the SunBlush Tomato is offered with this license, the provider would be obligated to share this Comprehensive Insight, ensuring transparency and allowing recipients to fully understand and potentially replicate or adapt the offering. Basic Permissions : All rights granted under this License persist for the term of any applicable rights on the Offering and are irrevocable as long as the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to utilize the unmodified Offering. The outcome or product resulting from the use of a covered offering is governed by this License only if the outcome, considering its content, qualifies as a covered offering. This License recognizes your rights of fair use or other equivalents, as provided by applicable laws. You may create, utilize, and propagate covered offerings that you do not convey, without conditions, as long as your license remains valid. You may convey covered offerings to others solely for them to make modifications exclusively for you or to provide you with facilities for utilizing those offerings, ensuring that you adhere to the terms of this License when conveying any material for whic'h you don't hold the rights. Those who modify or utilize the covered offerings for you must act exclusively on your behalf, under your guidance, and on terms that prevent them from creating any unauthorized copies of your protected material outside their association with you. Conveying under any other circumstances is allowed only under the conditions stated in this License. Sublicensing is not permitted; the provisions of this License make it unnecessary. Full Disclosure : When distributing or granting access to an offering, providers shall present recipients with exhaustive information vital for a holistic comprehension of said offering. If the nature of the offering allows, mechanisms must be instituted to facilitate access and potential modifications. This obligation is unceasing. Transparency of Alterations : Any divergences or subsequent changes from the original state of the offering must be candidly revealed by Providers. Reciprocal Transparency Responsibility : Recipients, in accepting, utilizing or leveraging the offering, are duty-bound to maintain the essence of these guidelines. This involves ensuring visibility for any alterations, derivatives, or re-distributions they might engage in. This continuous obligation, akin to a \"share alike\" ethos, mandates proper acknowledgment of sources. Engagements with External Offerings : In instances where the offering is integrated with another outside the purview of this license, provisions of this license persist for the original offering, retaining its accessibility and modifiability. Supportive Documentation : Providers must supply any auxiliary resources or explanations that are crucial for the user's effective engagement with the offering. This includes understanding, using, or potentially altering the offering. Parallel Freedom Provision : Should there arise a scenario where the offering's redistribution curtails customary access or adaptability, an obligation rests upon Providers to concurrently offer an unfettered version. Scenario: A local farmer, Mr. Green, has developed a unique variety of tomato that is more resilient to pests and has a longer shelf life. He decides to distribute these tomatoes under the PATH License. As part of his distribution, he also provides detailed information on the cultivation process, the seeds used, and the modifications he made to achieve this variety. After some time, a large agribusiness company, BigFarm Corp., takes interest in Mr. Green's tomatoes. They decide to buy a large quantity, package them in a special way, and sell them as \"Premium Long-Lasting Tomatoes.\" However, in their packaging process, they use a proprietary method that seals the tomatoes in such a way that prevents recipients from extracting seeds for replanting. This method curtails the customary access to the seeds and the adaptability of the tomatoes (since recipients can't grow their own from these tomatoes). Application of Parallel Freedom Provision: Under the PATH License's \"Parallel Freedom Provision,\" BigFarm Corp. has an obligation. While they can sell the specially packaged \"Premium Long-Lasting Tomatoes,\" they must also offer a version of Mr. Green's tomatoes without the restrictive packaging. This ensures that customers who wish to access the seeds and understand the tomato's cultivation can do so. In essence, alongside their \"Premium\" version, they'd need to provide an \"unfettered\" version that adheres to the principles of the PATH License. Infringements and Repercussions : Undertakings that sidestep, subvert, or are in contradiction to this license's tenets render the action non-binding. Such infractions could lead to the temporary or permanent rescinding of the rights bestowed by this license upon the offender. Rights Assurance : This license is not in contravention of and does not diminish any entitlements that recipients might hold under applicable copyright laws, other relevant regulations, or patent or trademark obligations. Conveyance of Duties and Privileges : It falls upon Providers to unambiguously relay the responsibilities and advantages intrinsic to this license when distributing or granting access, thus empowering recipients with a lucid grasp of their entitlements and commitments. Disclaimer of Warranty and Limitation of Liability : The offering is provided \"as is\", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. In no event shall the Provider be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the offering or the use or other dealings in the offering. Versioning and Updates : This license may be updated or revised in the future. Each version will be distinguished by a unique version number. When an offering is distributed or accessed under a specific version of this license, it will remain under that version's terms unless explicitly updated to a newer version by the Provider. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms \u00b6 If you develop a new offering, whether it's a program, service, tangible good, or intangible asset, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it available under the terms of the Public Awareness & Transparent Heritage (PATH) License. This ensures transparency, equity, and community-centered practices in its distribution and exchange. To do so, attach the following notices to the offering. If it's a software program, it is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. one line to give the offering's name and a brief idea of what it does. Copyright (C) (year) (name of author) This offering is made available under the terms of the Public Awareness & Transparent Heritage (PATH) License v0.1. This offering is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the PATH License for more details. You should have received a copy of the Public Awareness & Transparent Heritage (PATH) License v0.1 along with this offering. If not, see https://docs.grassecon.org/commons/path Also add information on how to contact you. If your offering of software or service can interact with users remotely through a computer network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to get its details and source, if applicable. For example, if your offering is a web application, its interface could display a \"Details\" or \"Source\" link that leads users to an archive or description of the offering. There are many ways you could offer details, and different solutions will be better for different offerings; refer to the specific requirements of the PATH License.","title":"PATH License"},{"location":"commons/path/#public-awareness-transparent-heritage-path-license","text":"Version 0.1a August 22st 2023 Copyright \u00a9 2023 Grassroots Economics Foundation, Inc. https://grassecon.org/ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.","title":"Public Awareness &amp; Transparent Heritage (PATH) License"},{"location":"commons/path/#preamble","text":"In the spirit of knowledge sharing, the Public Awareness & Transparent Heritage (PATH) License aims to encourage transparency, equity, and community-centered practices in the distribution and exchange of all offerings, be they tangible goods, services, software, or intangible assets.

They are tools for mutual aid, peer-trust, and voluntary reciprocity rooted in care, not commerce. By creating a pool under this license, you affirm that the pool will not be used for wage replacement, speculation, or hidden monetization of service labor. 2.0 License Affirmations and Definitions \u00b6 By adopting the SPROUT License (Stewarded Pools for Relational Obligations and Unified Trust), the Pool Creator (hereinafter referred to as the \"Steward\") affirms the following legal and operational declarations: 2.1 Non-Commercial Intent \u00b6 The Pool established under this License shall not operate as a for-profit enterprise, commercial business, or financial services provider. The Pool shall not: - Generate income or revenue for any individual or organization; - Offer services or goods in exchange for currency; - Engage in speculative trading, token sales, or other capital market activities. Definition: \u201cBusiness\u201d refers to any organized activity undertaken with the intent to make a profit or financial return, including wage disbursement, contracting, or resale of commitments. 2.2 Voluntary and Peer-Curated Participation \u00b6 Participation in the Pool shall be strictly voluntary and limited to individuals or groups who have been invited, approved, or validated through a transparent, peer-based governance process. Definition: \u201cPeer-curated\u201d means access to the Pool is granted through a trust-based system of community evaluation or consensus, rather than open market or anonymous access. 2.3 Symbolic Commitments, Not Enforceable Debts \u00b6 All tokens, vouchers, or instruments entered into the Pool represent symbolic, non-enforceable commitments to contribute care, labor, or other community-recognized value. These instruments shall not be construed as contractual debts, IOUs, promissory notes, or securities. Definition: \u201cSymbolic commitment\u201d refers to a voluntary promise or expression of intent to provide goods or services, not backed by legal enforcement or monetary guarantee. 2.4 Mutual Aid Commons, Not Automated Vending or Payroll Mechanism \u00b6 The Pool operates as a commons-based system of mutual aid and community trust. It shall not function as: - A payroll or salary disbursement mechanism; - A contract delivery platform; - An automated financial vending machine; - A marketplace for wage-equivalent or fixed-price service exchange. Definition: \u201cCommons of care\u201d means a resource system collectively maintained and governed by a defined group for mutual benefit, without the intention of private ownership or profit extraction. 3.0 Core Principles of the SPROUT License \u00b6 The following principles shall be binding for all Pools operating under this License. These principles define the legal and ethical boundaries of pool design, acceptance of commitments, and inter-pool cooperation. 3.1 Principle of Care over Commerce \u00b6 Pools shall operate as systems of care, reciprocity, and mutual recognition. Under no circumstance shall a Pool be designed or utilized for commercial purposes, speculative gains, or personal profit. Interpretation: Trust, not money, is the core unit of value. All tokenized activity must reflect contribution, not compensation. 3.2 Voluntary and Non-Coercive Participation \u00b6 All exchanges, redemptions, and contributions within the Pool must be strictly voluntary. No participant shall be contractually obligated to fulfill any specific service or deliverable. 3.3 Transparent Purpose-Linked Tracking \u00b6 All token swaps and redemptions shall be recorded on a verifiable ledger with a declared, non-generic purpose (e.g., \u201crecognition for composting,\u201d \u201cseed-sharing rotation\u201d). Requirement: Every transaction must include metadata linking it to the contributor\u2019s claimed commitment. 3.4 Prohibition on Wage Substitution \u00b6 Pools may not simulate payroll structures, distribute tokens in fixed intervals for time-based work, or replace wage labor under another guise. Any behavior approximating salaried or freelance contracting may be grounds for license revocation. 3.5 Peer-Curated Acceptance \u00b6 Only known, verified, and trusted members of the Pool may have their vouchers accepted in the Pool. The Pool must maintain documented governance procedures for who may issue, and under what limits. 3.6 Symbolic, Non-Enforceable Commitments \u00b6 Vouchers are to be treated as symbolic representations of intent to contribute, not legally enforceable IOUs. They do not constitute financial claims, debts, or instruments of exchange under banking or securities law. 3.7 Prohibition on Fiat Redemption \u00b6 No Pool may offer direct fiat, e-money, or cryptocurrency redemption services. Swaps must occur within the bounded mutual aid network. 3.8 Endowment Integrity \u00b6 All resource injections into the Pool (e.g., stablecoins, airtime, food) must be classified as gifts or irrevocable endowments. They shall not accrue interest, create claims of ownership, or imply investor rights. 3.9 Federated Governance Respect \u00b6 When federated with other Pools, each Pool must honor the local rules, curation logic, and trust boundaries of the partner Pools. No bypassing of peer control mechanisms is permitted. 4.0 Responsibilities of Pool Stewards \u00b6 All individuals or entities creating or operating a Pool under this License (\u201cStewards\u201d) agree to: Maintain a publicly accessible written Charter aligning with this License. Document all swaps and redemptions on a permanent, auditable ledger. Clearly define and display all roles, voucher issuers, and operating logic. Provide provenance documentation for any seeded assets or external inputs. Prohibit anonymous or uncurated token acceptance or participation. Utilize digital or analog systems (e.g., Sarafu.Network) that support transparent and permissioned pooling. 5.0 Violations and Enforcement \u00b6 Any Pool found to be in violation of this License, including but not limited to the following actions, may have its SPROUT License status revoked by Grassroots Economics Foundation: Engaging in disguised wage disbursement or payroll simulation. Misleading participants regarding the redeemability or liquidity of tokens. Facilitating speculative trading or enabling anonymous token swaps. Violating the federation logic or consent of linked Pools. Upon substantiated violation, the Pool may be: Flagged for audit and publicly reviewed; Temporarily suspended from federation networks; Required to issue a remediation report and governance reform. Grassroots Economics Foundation reserves the right to enforce these conditions in accordance with documented governance processes and community consensus. 6.0 Licensing Notice (Mandatory for Sarafu.Network and Affiliates) \u00b6 By accepting this License, the Steward affirms compliance with these foundational conditions and agrees to maintain the Pool\u2019s operations in accordance with the spirit and legal framework of the SPROUT License.

This is achieved through mutually accepted and defined Instruments sharing surplus value, cost and risk equitably between real people and associations subscriber Members as follows: Producers and Users - creators of economic value and Instrument from shared use of Commons. Steward - active providers of core Commons development and management services Guardians - communication obligations and passive veto rights over Commons use. Organising Principles \u00b6 Care for People \u2013 collaboration and vision driven care for oneself and others\u2019 well-being and happiness Care for the Environment - support environmental protection and regeneration, minimize use of finite resources for economic activity, ecosystem management approach to farming and business development. Fairness - fair and secure access to Instruments, land, resources, knowledge & care for members from different backgrounds, age, gender and religion. Reciprocity \u2013 mutual sharing of risk, cost and surplus Non-Dominance - no person or association to have dominant rights over another person or association\u2019s resources eg. data, finances, intellect, materials and freedom. Resilience - capacity to prepare for, address and adapt to economic, political, climate and other events in order to ensure sustainable community based systems/commons. Note that principals should be specific with how these Values are incorporated into objective and measurable Principles and Good Practices. Institutions and Instruments \u00b6 \u00b6 Ledger {#ledger} Ledgers are shared digital accounting databases which enumerate and qualify Instruments subject to mutual agreements or organizational rules. Instruments - bilateral mutual agreements or contracts between Members. Registration - publication of Instruments in machine-readable form executable on the Ledger. Management - Core Service Providers manage Ledgers subject to Clearing Agreements Issuer: Members individually or in association mutually agree in writing to meet obligations of registered Instruments. \u00b6 Community Asset Voucher (CAV) {#community-asset-voucher-cav} A Community Asset Voucher (CAV) is an instrument used within an Economic Commons to facilitate economic transactions and foster community development. CAV is designed to promote local trade, social cohesion, & sustainable practices. It can be considered both grassroots and circular in nature. As a grassroots instrument, CAV is often initiated and managed by local communities, enabling them to address their specific economic needs and priorities. It also embodies circular principles by incorporating mechanisms such as trade balance, expiration & re-issuance (demurrage), as well as drawing inspiration from indigenous practices of rotational mutual aid. CAVs encourage economic interactions that prioritize community well-being and the equitable distribution of resources while promoting sustainable and regenerative practices CAV \u2013 a promise denominated in a Unit of Account issued to an acceptor (i.e as a gift, in exchange for money or in-kind) and representing an assignable credit obligation of the Issuer to the acceptor or assignee. CAVs have the following properties.: Redemption: Vouchers presented in payment to the Issuer for goods and services supplied must be accepted in payment and are therefore redeemable. Digital Representation: digital Vouchers are defined and registered securely and immutably by Members on a public Ledger. Transparency: Instrument specifications are open to the general public while registered transactions are open to Members subject to the Clearing Agreement. Divisibility: Vouchers may be divided by the Issuer to the degree of precision specified when published on the Ledger. So the holder of a single Voucher may assign a fraction to another Member as digitally specified by the Issuer. Name and Symbol and Contract Address: Each Voucher must have a name and symbol specified by the Issuer, and a unique Contract Address (public key). Contact Information: The Voucher must include contact information for the Holder to know how to redeem the Voucher as payment for the Issuer's products. The Issuer must keep this information accurate and up-to date. Unit of Account: Standard unit of measure for value in exchange. Each Voucher issued by a Member should specify a Unit of Account. Example: 1000 Vouchers can be said to be redeemable by the Issuing Member for 1000 Kenyan Shillings worth of the Issuing Member\u2019s products. Expiration: Vouchers may have a specified expiration date or an expiration rate. Expiration Rate: For example, a Voucher with an expiration rate of 2% per month would result in a holder having 98 Vouchers at the end of the month, if the holder had 100 Vouchers at the beginning of the month. Expiration Date: For example a Voucher with an expiration date of one month would result in a holder having 0 usable Vouchers at the end of the month, if the holder had 100 Vouchers at the beginning of the month. Sink Account and Issuance Period: Expired Vouchers will accrue in a specified Ledger account determined by the Issuer after a specified Issuance period. This means that the balance of Vouchers in the Sink Account will increase by the sum of expired Vouchers, after the Issuance Period. Supply: The supply of Vouchers may be increased or destroyed by vote of the Issuers. The supply of Vouchers shall always be based on the Issuer's capacity to redeem them as payment for their products within the specified expiration. Fungibility: Each Voucher is fungible with the vouchers issued under that same contract, meaning that it is interchangeable and mixable with them. An account holding multiple identical Vouchers would display the sum of their quantity as their Voucher Balance minus any expired Vouchers. Bearer Instrument: The Voucher is a \u201cdigital bearer instrument\u201d, meaning that anyone holding the access (private) key to the holder's Ledger account is considered the owner of the Voucher or Vouchers in that account. Note that Members may share keys or create accounts that require specific signing rules (like any 2 of 3 to sign). Utility: The Voucher is not marketed or sold by Members as an investment product. It confers no additional rights or benefits beyond the redemption for the Issuer's products. Liability: The Voucher is a credit obligation with joint and several liability of the Issuer. This means that the Issuers are collectively and individually responsible for fulfilling the obligation of the Voucher. Finality: Once published and registered on the Ledger certain Immutable Information cannot change while Mutable Information can be changed by Voucher Contract Manager. Immutable Information includes: Name, Symbol Expiration dates and rates Re-issuance period Precision Contract Address* (public Key) Unit of Account* Description* Issuer Name* Namespace*= An domain for which to register the Voucher. Proofs* (media files, hashes or attachments) Version number* Image* (optional logo) Address of Mutable Information (derived)* Valid from* (date that the contract was published) Valid until* (date that the information is considered outdated) Mutable Information* includes: Voucher Contract Manager (public key) Voucher supply (via minting or burning) Sink address Contact information* Name, phone number, email, location, country Signers (who attest to the certificate information being connected to the Voucher) (*) Note that all the above information is data stored and registered on a Certificate which is published on the Ledger Voucher Contract Management: The Voucher Contract (Smart contract) registered and published on the Ledger has a Manager that can edit the Mutable Information in the Voucher Contract. The default Manager is the Member that published the contract and who may transfer Management to any Account on the Ledger and also remove themselves as an Manager. Management can be transferred to a Smart Contract that enables different forms of voting etc. \u00b6 CAV Pool {#cav-pool} CAV Pool \u2013 a treasury object that can hold digital assets and enables exchange between them. The following are properties of Pools: Qualification: Pools are collections of digital objects with various exchangeability to each other. I.e. CAVs can be made redeemable for the other CAVs within the pool. By adding CAVs to the pool one can automatically receive an equivalent amount of other CAVs available to the Pool contract. Finality: Mutable Information published and registered on the Ledger may be amended by a Certificate Publisher but Immutable Information may not. Specification: (TBD) Acceptance: Which Vouchers are allowed in the pool Caps: The maximum quantity of each voucher allowed in the pool Price Index: Relative prices for the vouchers in the pool Pool Fees: A fee can be placed on exchanges and the Manager can assign where these fees go. Pool Management: The Manager of the Pool has permission to edit Mutable Information in the Pool. The default Manager is the Publishing Member who may assign Management to another Member and also resign as a Manager. A Pool Manager can also be a group operating a multi-signature wallet. \u00b6 Certificate {#certificate} Certificate (Bilateral/Unilateral Instrument) \u2013 a data object qualified as acceptable by another Member. A Certificate is similar to a University Diploma in which the University makes an attestation (qualification) that a Student has passed their coursework. The following are properties of Certificates: Qualification: Certificates qualify data such as Voucher usage or capacity to perform services. Vouchers as well as Members may be Certified by other Members, for various roles, services, accomplishments and so on. Certification qualifies Members or Instruments. Note in the Voucher Instrument example, Immutable and Mutable data are stored or referenced on a Certificate (denoted by (*)) No Obligation: on Issuers to accept their Certificates in exchange for goods & services. Finality: Mutable Information published and registered on the Ledger may be amended by a Certificate Publisher but Immutable Information may not. Certificate Management: the Manager of Certificate (Instrument) Publication and registration on the Ledger has permission to edit Mutable Information in the Certificate. The default Manager is the Publishing Member who may assign Management to another Member and also resign as a Manager. Revocation or Expiration: a Certificate can expire and/or be revoked but the chain of attestation will be preserved on the Ledger. Acceptance or Denial: the Member holding the Private Key to the public address of the Certificate can accept, deny and comment on the validity of the Certificate Finality: Immutable Properties of the Certificate cannot be amended once published and registered on the Ledger, Governance \u00b6 \u00b6 Membership {#membership} A Member of an Economic Commons is an individual person, organization or an association of Members with a common purpose, who ratify and Implement an Economic Commons it or use implemented Economic Commons Instruments as per their local needs There are three Member Classes defined below, with the following rights and obligations: General Members Right to utilize all Economic Commons-defined Instruments Right to hold or delegate custodianship of Ledger Accounts and Instruments Right to hold multiple Accounts and Instruments in the Ledger Right to vote on the usage of their issued Instruments in a Community Fund Right to view and inspect all Accounts and Instrument kept on the Ledger Obligation to report Members that don't comply to this Agreement or local laws Obligation to certify Core Service Providers Obligation to register any Instrument or Instrument usage on the Ledger and keep any relevant information up to date.

CAV is designed to promote local trade, social cohesion, & sustainable practices. It can be considered both grassroots and circular in nature. As a grassroots instrument, CAV is often initiated and managed by local communities, enabling them to address their specific economic needs and priorities. It also embodies circular principles by incorporating mechanisms such as trade balance, expiration & re-issuance (demurrage), as well as drawing inspiration from indigenous practices of rotational mutual aid. CAVs encourage economic interactions that prioritize community well-being and the equitable distribution of resources while promoting sustainable and regenerative practices CAV \u2013 a promise denominated in a Unit of Account issued to an acceptor (i.e as a gift, in exchange for money or in-kind) and representing an assignable credit obligation of the Issuer to the acceptor or assignee. CAVs have the following properties.: Redemption: Vouchers presented in payment to the Issuer for goods and services supplied must be accepted in payment and are therefore redeemable. Digital Representation: digital Vouchers are defined and registered securely and immutably by Members on a public Ledger. Transparency: Instrument specifications are open to the general public while registered transactions are open to Members subject to the Clearing Agreement. Divisibility: Vouchers may be divided by the Issuer to the degree of precision specified when published on the Ledger. So the holder of a single Voucher may assign a fraction to another Member as digitally specified by the Issuer. Name and Symbol and Contract Address: Each Voucher must have a name and symbol specified by the Issuer, and a unique Contract Address (public key). Contact Information: The Voucher must include contact information for the Holder to know how to redeem the Voucher as payment for the Issuer's products. The Issuer must keep this information accurate and up-to date. Unit of Account: Standard unit of measure for value in exchange. Each Voucher issued by a Member should specify a Unit of Account. Example: 1000 Vouchers can be said to be redeemable by the Issuing Member for 1000 Kenyan Shillings worth of the Issuing Member\u2019s products. Expiration: Vouchers may have a specified expiration date or an expiration rate. Expiration Rate: For example, a Voucher with an expiration rate of 2% per month would result in a holder having 98 Vouchers at the end of the month, if the holder had 100 Vouchers at the beginning of the month. Expiration Date: For example a Voucher with an expiration date of one month would result in a holder having 0 usable Vouchers at the end of the month, if the holder had 100 Vouchers at the beginning of the month. Sink Account and Issuance Period: Expired Vouchers will accrue in a specified Ledger account determined by the Issuer after a specified Issuance period. This means that the balance of Vouchers in the Sink Account will increase by the sum of expired Vouchers, after the Issuance Period. Supply: The supply of Vouchers may be increased or destroyed by vote of the Issuers. The supply of Vouchers shall always be based on the Issuer's capacity to redeem them as payment for their products within the specified expiration. Fungibility: Each Voucher is fungible with the vouchers issued under that same contract, meaning that it is interchangeable and mixable with them. An account holding multiple identical Vouchers would display the sum of their quantity as their Voucher Balance minus any expired Vouchers. Bearer Instrument: The Voucher is a \u201cdigital bearer instrument\u201d, meaning that anyone holding the access (private) key to the holder's Ledger account is considered the owner of the Voucher or Vouchers in that account. Note that Members may share keys or create accounts that require specific signing rules (like any 2 of 3 to sign). Utility: The Voucher is not marketed or sold by Members as an investment product. It confers no additional rights or benefits beyond the redemption for the Issuer's products. Liability: The Voucher is a credit obligation with joint and several liability of the Issuer. This means that the Issuers are collectively and individually responsible for fulfilling the obligation of the Voucher. Finality: Once published and registered on the Ledger certain Immutable Information cannot change while Mutable Information can be changed by Voucher Contract Manager. Immutable Information includes: Name, Symbol Expiration dates and rates Re-issuance period Precision Contract Address* (public Key) Unit of Account* Description* Issuer Name* Namespace*= An domain for which to register the Voucher. Proofs* (media files, hashes or attachments) Version number* Image* (optional logo) Address of Mutable Information (derived)* Valid from* (date that the contract was published) Valid until* (date that the information is considered outdated) Mutable Information* includes: Voucher Contract Manager (public key) Voucher supply (via minting or burning) Sink address Contact information* Name, phone number, email, location, country Signers (who attest to the certificate information being connected to the Voucher) (*) Note that all the above information is data stored and registered on a Certificate which is published on the Ledger Voucher Contract Management: The Voucher Contract (Smart contract) registered and published on the Ledger has a Manager that can edit the Mutable Information in the Voucher Contract. The default Manager is the Member that published the contract and who may transfer Management to any Account on the Ledger and also remove themselves as an Manager.

At the heart of this work is commitment pooling : not a new invention, but a recognition of living coordination patterns already woven into traditional, ecological, and relational systems. These pools function as metabolic trust systems \u2014vessels of promises and collective memory that help communities organize care and value beyond the confines of extractive markets or centralized institutions. From ancestral seed-sharing to mycorrhizal nutrient networks , commitment pooling mirrors the way life has always coordinated. This charter offers 16 strategic principles for regenerating economies through shared memory and shared responsibility . Each principle is a seed\u2014rooted in movement-building, relational ethics, and regenerative protocol design. They are meant to support local stewards as they grow this paradigm within trust-rich communities and then propagate it outward. It is a call to remember: That value can be coordinated through mutual care. That economies can emerge from relationships. That resilience is grown\u2014not imposed\u2014through shared intention, humility, and joy. What Is Commitment Pooling? \u00b6 A Relational System of Care and Credit \u00b6 Commitment pooling is a protocol where value flows through promises, reciprocity, and shared memory . It allows communities to coordinate labor, time, resources, and care based on trust rather than transaction. It tracks commitments: who has offered what, and how that care circulates. These commitments may be held in verbal agreements, local ledgers, or digital tools\u2014but the protocol is not new. It is not invented, it is remembered. Commitment pooling echoes: - What fungi do beneath the forest floor, - What grandparents do across generations, - What communities do in times of need. It is a living system of coordination \u2014emerging from ecological rhythms of exchange, ancestral protocols of shared responsibility, and the cultural logic of \u201cwe belong to each other.\u201d In its essence, commitment pooling is not a financial tool . It is a pattern of relational stewardship . It is a metabolism of trust \u2014where every promise is part of a larger story, and every fulfillment nourishes the commons. Vision \u00b6 We envision a world where communities coordinate value through trust, shared memory, and mutual care\u2014where economic life is rooted in relationship, reciprocity, and belonging. \ud83d\udee0 Mission \u00b6 Demonstrate, design, disseminate & curate the best technologies and practices to empower communities to create and manage their own economic agreements. We offer tools and documentation to enable communities to: - Create Commons - Enable interactions between Community Asset Vouchers , Commitment Pools , and technologies - Implement systems that are flexible , comprehensible , and locally appropriate How We Work \u00b6 Identify and define shared concepts across technologies, commitment economies, and resource coordination Translate these into low-cost , modular , technology-agnostic documentation and tooling Contribute to infrastructure usable on any device , especially low-end/offline-capable Prioritize local implementation and decentralized stewardship Support implementers as contributors , not just consumers Ensure smooth migration of financial instruments between systems Improve privacy properties akin to cash-like bearer instruments Build a global, open-source knowledge base of Commons Avoid monopolization of services; empower communities to self-host and self-govern Principles for Spreading Commitment Pooling \u00b6 Here are 16 guiding principles for spreading commitment pooling globally, drawn from lessons in movement strategy, influence theory, and regenerative protocol design. Each principle honors the path forward while remaining mindful of the systems we seek to evolve beyond. Honor the Existing Systems, Even as You Outgrow Them The legacy financial system persists not because it\u2019s perfect, but because it solved real coordination problems -for some, for a while. Acknowledge the ingenuity and pain that shaped it. We\u2019re not here to attack; we\u2019re here to invite. Respect builds the bridge to change. Seed a Strategy with Deep Time in Mind This is a generational shift. Think in cycles of 7, 70, or 700 years. Anchor your work in long-term planetary wellbeing. Build protocols that will last longer than empires. Engage the Heart, Not Just the Head Engage Heart, Head and Hands Money is emotional. It touches survival, status, shame, and dreams. Commitment pooling must speak to love, community, and the ancestral desire to belong. Rituals, stories, and symbols are essential infrastructure. This Is Ancient, Not New We are not inventing. We are remembering. Mycorrhizal fungi coordinate nutrients. Villages shared calabashes of stored grain. Pools are old as roots. Frame the work as restoration, not disruption.

At the heart of this work is commitment pooling : not a new invention, but a recognition of living coordination patterns already woven into traditional, ecological, and relational systems. These pools function as metabolic trust systems \u2014vessels of promises and collective memory that help communities organize care and value beyond the confines of extractive markets or centralized institutions. From ancestral seed-sharing to mycorrhizal nutrient networks , commitment pooling mirrors the way life has always coordinated. This charter offers 16 strategic principles for regenerating economies through shared memory and shared responsibility . Each principle is a seed\u2014rooted in movement-building, relational ethics, and regenerative protocol design. They are meant to support local stewards as they grow this paradigm within trust-rich communities and then propagate it outward. It is a call to remember: That value can be coordinated through mutual care. That economies can emerge from relationships. That resilience is grown\u2014not imposed\u2014through shared intention, humility, and joy.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"community/charter/#what-is-commitment-pooling","text":"","title":"What Is Commitment Pooling?"},{"location":"community/charter/#a-relational-system-of-care-and-credit","text":"Commitment pooling is a protocol where value flows through promises, reciprocity, and shared memory . It allows communities to coordinate labor, time, resources, and care based on trust rather than transaction. It tracks commitments: who has offered what, and how that care circulates. These commitments may be held in verbal agreements, local ledgers, or digital tools\u2014but the protocol is not new. It is not invented, it is remembered. Commitment pooling echoes: - What fungi do beneath the forest floor, - What grandparents do across generations, - What communities do in times of need. It is a living system of coordination \u2014emerging from ecological rhythms of exchange, ancestral protocols of shared responsibility, and the cultural logic of \u201cwe belong to each other.\u201d In its essence, commitment pooling is not a financial tool . It is a pattern of relational stewardship . It is a metabolism of trust \u2014where every promise is part of a larger story, and every fulfillment nourishes the commons.","title":"A Relational System of Care and Credit"},{"location":"community/charter/#vision","text":"We envision a world where communities coordinate value through trust, shared memory, and mutual care\u2014where economic life is rooted in relationship, reciprocity, and belonging.","title":"Vision"},{"location":"community/charter/#mission","text":"Demonstrate, design, disseminate & curate the best technologies and practices to empower communities to create and manage their own economic agreements.

Each principle honors the path forward while remaining mindful of the systems we seek to evolve beyond. Honor the Existing Systems, Even as You Outgrow Them The legacy financial system persists not because it\u2019s perfect, but because it solved real coordination problems -for some, for a while. Acknowledge the ingenuity and pain that shaped it. We\u2019re not here to attack; we\u2019re here to invite. Respect builds the bridge to change. Seed a Strategy with Deep Time in Mind This is a generational shift. Think in cycles of 7, 70, or 700 years. Anchor your work in long-term planetary wellbeing. Build protocols that will last longer than empires. Engage the Heart, Not Just the Head Engage Heart, Head and Hands Money is emotional. It touches survival, status, shame, and dreams. Commitment pooling must speak to love, community, and the ancestral desire to belong. Rituals, stories, and symbols are essential infrastructure. This Is Ancient, Not New We are not inventing. We are remembering. Mycorrhizal fungi coordinate nutrients. Villages shared calabashes of stored grain. Pools are old as roots. Frame the work as restoration, not disruption.

Humanitarian support and remittances provide temporary relief, but don\u2019t unlock endogenous development . \u201cThere is land to farm and people to farm it \u2014 but no way to coordinate those capacities.\u201d The community's greatest need is food sovereignty. They have land, seeds, and labor, but they lack a metabolic trust system to route commitments. They are stuck in a cycle of subsistence. Within this region, one self-organized group\u2014 Binguni \u2014operates as a savings collective (a chama/VSLA), supporting members through pooled funds. But with limited liquidity, their dreams of community farming remain unfulfilled. \ud83e\udded Enter: Commitment Pooling \u00b6 A Core Service Provider (CSP) introduces Binguni to Commitment Pooling , a regenerative coordination protocol enabling them to recognize and activate trust among themselves. Through workshops, the group learns that: Commitments are not assets\u2014they are promises of future contributions . Vouchers can represent those promises, traceable and redeemable. A Commitment Pool allows members to seed their promises and withdraw others\u2019, creating a metabolic flow of goods, services, and labor. The CSP helps Binguni map their collective capacity , and the group discovers over 50,000 KES worth of monthly redeemable value\u2014from seeds and water to cooking and labor. They decide to co-issue a Community Asset Voucher (CAV) named BIGI , backed by this internal value. \ud83e\udd1d Forming a Trust Protocol \u00b6 To activate their CAV system, the Binguni group formalizes three agreements: Economic Commons Agreement \u2014 Members agree to enter a shared ecosystem based on trust, fulfillment, and community rules. Membership Agreement \u2014 They: Quantify and audit individual commitments (e.g. James commits 10kg seeds worth 2500 KES). Set group issuance limits (max 50,000 BIGIs). Agree on internal credit limits and a demurrage system (e.g., 2% monthly decay to encourage flow). Create a shared reserve by pooling part of their vouchers (e.g., 200 BIGIs each). CU Intermember Agreement \u2014 Defines roles of the CSP (ledger access, arbitration, training). This trust fabric enables Binguni to mint 50,000 BIGIs , with 2,300 going to each member and 4,000 held in the communal pool for a shared farm project. \ud83d\udd01 Circulation: Commitments Come Alive \u00b6 Commitment Pooling begins: James gives 20 BIGIs to Pamela for cakes. Pamela pays Joyce 200 BIGIs for help cooking. Joyce spends 300 BIGIs on water from John . Midday snapshot: Member BIGI Balance Pamela 2120 Joyce 2200 John 2600 At a community market, Pamela sells potatoes: - 50 sold in BIGIs to Binguni members = 250 BIGIs - 50 sold in shillings = 250 KES Her balance rises to 2370 BIGIs + 250 KES. This dual liquidity model boosts both savings and circulation . \ud83c\udf3e Project Activation \u00b6 Binguni uses their pooled reserve to jumpstart a community farm , but lack enough labor. They approach a neighboring group\u2014 Mbele , whose women farmers agree to accept BIGIs as partial payment. Trust has now crossed group boundaries , routed through redeemed commitments. Inspired, Mbele decides to form their own Commitment Pool and issue MBELE vouchers, backed by their services (e.g., erosion control, water management). Binguni and Mbele cross-accept each other\u2019s vouchers. Their pools are distinct, but interoperable\u2014forming a meshed commons . \u201cBIGIs and MBELEs start to flow between the groups, stitching capacity into coordination.\u201d \ud83c\udf31 Coordination and Learning \u00b6 Both groups invest part of their reserve vouchers into group businesses \u2014like a maize mill and agroforestry training. The CSP provides skill-building and protocol stewardship, ensuring that: Trust flows are conserved Commitments are fulfilled Exchange remains relational, not extractive John , the plow-owner, begins accepting both BIGIs and MBELEs, confident in their redeemability. The metabolic economy has begun. \ud83e\udd32 Humanitarian Support (Reimagined) \u00b6 An aid agency observes the thriving local trade and decides to support the system rather than override it. Two Options: \u00b6 Infrastructure Investment : Buy assets (e.g., boreholes, mills) that expand productive capacity\u2014enabling more commitments and larger pools . CAV Prepurchase : Buy BIGIs and MBELEs from the groups (like CVA), and redistribute to vulnerable households\u2014 routing dignity through redemption . This support creates local multiplier effects rather than extraction. Vouchers circulate multiple times before being redeemed, and every redemption is a fulfilled promise , not a sale. \u201cInstead of aid leaving the community in one transaction, it bounces\u2014amplifying trust.\u201d \ud83e\udeb4 Lessons from Binguni and Mbele \u00b6 A community\u2019s lack of money is not a lack of value\u2014it\u2019s a lack of memory and coordination . Commitment Pooling restores that memory by recording, authenticating, and routing promises. CAVs are not currency\u2014they\u2019re metabolic trust tokens. This is not a market.

It is not a product, asset, or money. A voucher is a traceable commitment , issued with trust and fulfilled with care. What is Commitment Pooling? \u00b6 Commitment pooling is a protocol for coordinated cooperation . It lets people and groups seed their promises into a shared pool, track who has fulfilled what, and swap commitments to meet local needs. It is not invented\u2014it is remembered . It echoes seed exchanges, care webs, and mutual aid traditions found across cultures. How do I create a Voucher? \u00b6 You issue a voucher when you make a clear, witnessed promise\u2014for example: - \u201cI will provide 10kg of maize\u201d - \u201cI offer 5 hours of tutoring\u201d That voucher starts in your Own Held , and you can then seed it into a shared pool for others to access. How is the value of a Voucher determined? \u00b6 By the issuer. Most use simple parity measures (e.g., 1 voucher = 1 unit of service or goods). Value arises from trusted redeemability , not external pricing. How do I get more Vouchers? \u00b6 You can: - Fulfill a voucher from someone else (builds trust) - Issue your own , backed by capacity you control - Swap your voucher for another through the pool What is a Commitment Pool? \u00b6 It\u2019s a shared, type-keyed registry of unfulfilled commitments . The pool is where trust is stored, tracked, and routed. Only seeded promises appear here\u2014others must be offered directly or fulfilled privately. \ud83d\udee0 Practicing Pool Logic \u00b6 What happens when I seed a Voucher? \u00b6 Your Debt increases Your Own Held decreases The Pool gains access to your promise This signals to others: \u201cI stand ready to fulfill this.\u201d What does it mean to swap Vouchers? \u00b6 You exchange your Own Held voucher (your promise) for someone else\u2019s from the pool. It\u2019s not barter\u2014it's routing unmet needs to willing contributors . What does it mean to redeem a Voucher? \u00b6 Redemption happens when someone calls in a promise . You fulfill the good or service. The voucher returns to you, and you can reuse or re-seed it. Redemption is not repayment. It is trust, fulfilled. What is Trade Balance? \u00b6 Trade balance = promises kept vs. promises received. - Positive = you\u2019ve given more than you\u2019ve received - Negative = you owe service/care back into the pool What if I can\u2019t fulfill my promise? \u00b6 Communicate early. Pools work on trust. Unfulfilled redemptions can hurt the whole group. Mediation, fallback agreements, or swap reversals may be used. \ud83c\udf31 Starting a Commitment Pool \u00b6 Do I need permission to start? \u00b6 No. Commitment Pooling is a permissionless trust logic. To begin: 1. Make a promise 2. Record it 3. Share it with others A promise and a witness are enough. How do I invite others? \u00b6 Start with people who already exchange informally Use memory, not marketing Ask: \u201cWhat can we promise one another?\u201d What tools can I use? \u00b6 USSD or SMS (for basic phones) Sarafu.Network (web interface) Paper ledgers or slips (for offline pools) Community boards or airtime logs (local record-keeping) What if others won\u2019t accept my voucher? \u00b6 Trust needs to grow: - Seed first - Redeem someone else\u2019s voucher to show reciprocity - Document fulfilled promises \ud83e\udd32 Group Agreements \u00b6 Can groups issue Vouchers? \u00b6 Yes. Groups can: - Make collective promises (e.g., \u201cWe will host a weekly clinic\u201d) - Pool member contributions - Use seeded vouchers to support shared projects or care roles What happens if someone misuses the pool? \u00b6 Memory protects the pool. Every action is recorded. If someone repeatedly fails to redeem their promises, others can: - Pause swaps with them - Redeem only with trusted issuers - Use group governance or fallback protocols Do Vouchers expire? \u00b6 Vouchers may include expiration windows to prevent hoarding. For example: - 2% monthly demurrage (encourages use) - Return to group fund if idle for too long Expiry terms are agreed at pool setup. Is the technology open source? \u00b6 Yes. You can fork or contribute at: github.com/grassrootseconomics \ud83d\udca1 Philosophy \u00b6 Why use a pool instead of currency? \u00b6 Because coordination is often more scarce than money. Pools: - Honor local labor and care - Avoid market extraction - Amplify mutuality and visibility - Give people tools to trust at scale What are the benefits of Commitment Pooling? \u00b6 Trust routing instead of price discovery A shared metabolic memory of what\u2019s been offered, fulfilled, and needed Strengthened agency without waiting for outside approval What if I just want to help? \u00b6 Join a pool and seed a small promise Fulfill someone else\u2019s commitment Support those recording pool memory (tech stewards, scribes, elders) Tell your story\u2014memory multiplies trust \ud83c\udfaf Final Word \u00b6 Commitment pooling is not a system to be sold\u2014it is a field of care to be remembered. When we track promises together, we restore dignity to coordination. Let the pools begin.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"edu/faq/#frequently-asked-questions-faq","text":"This FAQ supports the Training Guide and Glossary .","title":"\ud83d\udcd8 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)"},{"location":"edu/faq/#basics","text":"","title":"\ud83d\udd30 Basics"},{"location":"edu/faq/#what-is-a-voucher","text":"A voucher is a promise of future contribution \u2014such as labor, goods, or services\u2014that can be redeemed by someone else.

It introduces key concepts of trust-based coordination and shows how communities can begin organizing local economies through promises, mutual care, and shared memory\u2014not dependency on outside capital or centralized institutions. You\u2019ll gain a foundational understanding of: - What a CAV is as a promise of future contribution - How communities can seed and exchange these promises through a shared pool - What kind of community readiness and relational trust supports success This guide does not cover technical implementation or long-term governance, but gives enough background to know whether your community is ready to take the next steps toward creating a local commitment pool. If your community has already experimented with community vouchers, this guide can help reframe your experience into a metabolic system of commitments\u2014supporting deeper adoption and mutual accountability. Audience \u00b6 This guide is intended for: - Community organizers, project managers, trainers, and trust stewards - Chamas, mutual aid circles, community councils, savings groups - Humanitarian field workers, facilitators, and peer educators - Local businesses, students, farmers, youth and women's groups Participants should have some relationship with the local community and an interest in exploring how local value can be coordinated without relying solely on national currency. The ideal group size is 5\u201310 people to allow space for personal reflection and group learning. This guide is particularly useful for communities where vouchers have been granted or where people have received airdropped credits and want to build toward a more regenerative system based on ongoing reciprocal contribution. After completing this training, participants will: - Understand how promises and care can be tracked as credit - Be able to seed their own vouchers into a pool - Begin designing a local commitment system anchored in trust Some participants may go on to facilitate new pools or train others in their community, forming the basis for a distributed network of economic stewardship. Purpose of the Training \u00b6 Communities using or creating local vouchers need to understand the benefits, obligations, and responsibilities of participating in a Commitment Pool . The process is not about issuing money\u2014it is about organizing care , and recognizing that every member of a community has something to offer, regardless of their income or access to cash. A Community Asset Voucher is a formalized promise\u2014a unit of future contribution that can be shared, held, or fulfilled. When pooled together, these vouchers form a commons of commitment: a living ledger of mutual support. This training focuses on experiential learning . Each session is rooted in real exchange, storytelling, and reflection. Participants will practice: - Making and recording promises - Swapping commitments in a shared pool - Redeeming vouchers through community service Facilitators should understand the protocol and be prepared to explain how promises are tracked, how pools grow, and how communities self-regulate. More in-depth material is available in the Commitment Pool FAQ . Before You Start \u00b6 Community Asset Vouchers are not just tools\u2014they are expressions of community trust . Each CAV is a promise backed by a real good or service, and every pool is a memory system for those promises. Before starting, ask: - Do we have unmet needs and underused skills or resources? - Are members willing to promise what they can offer\u2014and fulfill what they owe? - Can we commit to tracking care and coordinating fairly? Commitment pooling is not a top-down solution. It is a bottom-up invitation to remember: we already know how to care for one another. This guide helps communities recover that memory, organize their promises, and begin weaving regenerative economies\u2014one commitment at a time. Why Commitment Pools and Community Vouchers? \u00b6 Community Asset Vouchers (CAVs) within a Commitment Pool are a way for communities to organize trust, launch regenerative projects, activate dormant resources, and grow resilience without relying on external institutions. Unlike national currency, which must be earned before it can be spent, CAVs are issued as formalized promises \u2014commitments to contribute goods or services in the future. When these promises are pooled, they create a living system of mutual credit, enabling communities to coordinate care, labor, and value in the absence of cash. Commitment Pools allow these vouchers to circulate in a way that mimics healthy ecological exchange: regenerative, reciprocal, and grounded in relationship. They create space for local initiative , while also opening possibilities for interaction with other economies through swap protocols and shared standards. A Commitment Pool is not just a tool\u2014it\u2019s a commons of memory and care. It allows each promise to ripple outward, nourishing projects, livelihoods, and mutual trust. What Commitment Pooling Can (and Can\u2019t) Do \u00b6 A Commitment Pool can : Support local projects and mutual aid through pooled commitments Expand community access to credit\u2014without interest, banks, or collateral Jump-start stalled economies where national currency is scarce Encourage participation from the whole community\u2014elders, youth, caretakers, farmers Recognize and reward labor that traditional economies ignore (e.g. caregiving, reforestation) Strengthen relationships between community members through ongoing mutual obligations Allow swapping of one type of commitment for another Reduce dependence on extractive financial systems Redistribute credit fairly through redeemable social agreements Anchor accountability and care through traceable fulfillment A Commitment Pool cannot : Operate without trust. Vouchers only work if people believe in\u2014and fulfill\u2014their promises. Function without curation. Communities must take responsibility for who seeds the pool and under what conditions. Work as a \u201cfree money\u201d system. Commitment Pooling requires reciprocal contribution, not passive receipt. Be maintained without memory. Each action must be recorded so that care is honored and the commons is preserved. Starting a Pool \u00b6 Rather than offering a pre-designed currency, Commitment Pools start by helping people make promises and see those promises fulfilled. Instead of a token airdrop or external injection of funds, pools begin with a local circle of contributors willing to seed their own vouchers\u2014representing time, food, care, repairs, or any redeemable good or service. These vouchers can then be swapped or withdrawn from the pool by others, creating circulation grounded in relationship. This method ensures that all value in the system is rooted in actual capacity , not speculation. Participants receive real experience: issuing, seeding, redeeming, and tracking commitments before formal launch. This helps the community develop strong governance and accountability practices before scaling. Creating Community Vouchers (CAVs) \u00b6 A Community Asset Voucher is not currency\u2014it\u2019s a promise of future value . CAVs are created by individuals or groups who agree to offer something of worth to others in the network. Each voucher must be backed 100% by the issuer\u2019s real ability to provide the good or service it represents. Through the Commitment Pooling protocol, these vouchers become part of a shared registry. They may be: Seeded into a pool to build credit and trust Swapped for other vouchers (e.g. labor exchanged for food) Held by others and later redeemed by returning to the issuer The circulation of vouchers maps the metabolism of the community: who is offering care, who is receiving it, and how trust flows over time. Gathering the Participants \u00b6 Every pool begins with a group of initial stewards: elders, producers, business owners, youth leaders, mutual aid groups. These are the people who will seed the first commitments , test the system, and encourage others to join through their example. The wider the participation, the stronger the pool. Diversity of contribution builds redundancy and resilience. Before launching, communities should ensure that: - Enough trusted members are ready to issue redeemable vouchers - There is clarity around how commitments are made and fulfilled - Someone is accountable for tracking and maintaining the memory of the pool Being Willing to Play \u00b6 This training is not theoretical. It is an invitation to experience the trust systems we are growing. Participants will practice: - Defining their commitments - Seeding vouchers into a shared pool - Swapping and redeeming based on collective need The exercises are designed to simulate a real commitment economy. Even if your community decides not to move forward, the act of mapping resources, offering promises, and fulfilling care is inherently valuable. At the end of the process, your group will have enough experience to make an informed decision: Are we ready to grow a trust-based economy? The answer begins with one promise. Let the pools begin. Course Implementation: Commitment Pooling for Community Economies \u00b6 Focus \u00b6 This course is rooted in the context of communities like those in Kenya, but it is adaptable to any place where people face economic exclusion and have unrecognized value to offer. Participants are members of mutual aid groups, chamas, churches, SILCs, cooperatives, local businesses, or informal networks who are ready to make and fulfill promises to one another. These groups are well-positioned to become Commitment Pool originators \u2014curating and seeding a shared registry of redeemable commitments, backed by real goods, services, or care work. The focus is not on creating a \u201ccurrency\u201d but rather on enabling local groups to grow a relational trust economy , using Community Vouchers to coordinate value that already exists. Goals \u00b6 By the end of this training, groups will: Be able to articulate clear commitments to the community\u2014stating what they will offer and under what conditions. Understand the process of seeding a voucher into a Commitment Pool and navigating the trust-based flows that follow. Map out who their stakeholders are and how to invite wider participation while maintaining accountability. Explore critical themes: The ethics of promise-making and fulfillment Trust as the foundation of value The function of trade balance and debt in pooled systems Reciprocity and care as economic infrastructure The group\u2019s role in cultivating a regenerative local economy Logistics \u00b6 Scripted + Flexible : This training is available in multiple languages and designed to be facilitated by experienced organizers who understand Commitment Pooling principles. The guide includes structured exercises to simulate real trust economies. Duration : Approximately 6 hours of facilitated sessions, including interactive simulations, reflection, and storytelling. Follow-up sessions are encouraged once participants begin designing or testing their own pools. Facilitation : Minimum 1 facilitator with practical experience in pooled voucher systems. Local mediators or trusted elders are encouraged to participate in order to validate commitments and support fulfillment processes. Co-facilitators can help play specific roles during simulations: voucher issuers, pool stewards, redeemers, or swap partners. Materials : Large writing surface (e.g., flipchart, blackboard) (Optional) Video examples or animations of Commitment Pooling in action Basic calculator or smartphone Game & Simulation Supplies: Paper slips to simulate vouchers (labelled with issuer and type) Tokens or beans as symbolic commitments (e.g. \u201c10 Eggs,\u201d \u201c1 Hour of Repair\u201d) Coins or different color papers for national currency exchange reference Mancala-style board or ground-based hole setup for visualizing trust flows ( see example ) For Participants: Notebook and pencil (Optional) Access to a demo version of the Sarafu.Network or a sample Commitment Pool interface via mobile or web Course Summary \u00b6 This course includes the following modules: Local Economies as Living Systems Mapping our unmet needs and underused capacities. Understanding where national currency fails\u2014and where promises can fill the gap. Community Voucher Creation & Pool Seeding Designing a commitment: defining what you can promise, how much, and how to fulfill. Learning how to seed, swap, and redeem within a Commitment Pool. Engagement & Memory How to introduce the idea of pooled trust to others. Creating visibility, building accountability, and recording the memory of exchange. Implementation Roadmap Reflecting on readiness. Planning for first seedings, setting credit limits, and identifying support roles for governance and redemption. At its heart, this course is about reclaiming economic authorship . It reminds participants: You don\u2019t need permission to care for one another. You don\u2019t need capital to build an economy of trust. You only need your word\u2014and someone who believes in it. Let the pools begin. Part 1. Local Economies \u00b6 Introduction \u00b6 A Community Voucher is not simply a new form of money\u2014it is a promise , backed by the real capacity of the issuer. When pooled together, these promises form the foundation of a Commitment Pool , a shared registry of redeemable commitments that enables trade even when national currency is scarce. Commitment Pooling is a protocol for community credit \u2014a way to circulate trust, route care, and organize abundance. Used well, it supports livelihoods, anchors collective projects, and builds economic resilience. Like any system of care, it requires maintenance. If promises go unfulfilled or memory breaks down, harm can occur. This guide models how such breakdowns happen\u2014and how communities can prevent them by tending their pool with care. History \u00b6 Before coins, before states, before banks\u2014there was trust. The earliest writing in human history was a list of labor promises: payments due for grain and care. Communities have always invented means of remembering who promised what to whom. From Mesopotamian tokens to mutual aid networks in Latin America, to rotating savings clubs (ROSCAs) in Kenya\u2014 economic coordination has always emerged from relationship . Community Vouchers and Commitment Pools are not new. They are a re-membering of forgotten methods\u2014made visible again for today's challenges. Why Pools? \u00b6 The central insight of Commitment Pooling is this: Communities often have more capacity than cash. People can grow food, fix roofs, teach skills, or care for elders\u2014but they cannot always exchange that value because the national currency is missing. By issuing vouchers for real goods and services\u2014and pooling those commitments\u2014communities unlock that trapped potential. A voucher like \u201c10 eggs\u201d or \u201c1 hour of childcare\u201d can circulate before national currency arrives. The result: trade happens, needs are met, and value remains rooted locally. Resource Mapping and Ecosystem Design \u00b6 Let\u2019s imagine a voucher system where someone seeds a promise for 100 chapatis\u2014but only ever spends that credit on flour, which cycles back to chapatis. This creates a closed loop , which may be functional but limited. Instead, we want to map a diverse metabolic network : - What kinds of value can circulate? - What goods and services are abundant? - What leaks out (imports)? - What can be redirected or reimagined? This mapping helps communities shape trust routes and prepare for full-cycle redemption. It also reveals whether they can become self-reliant \u2014not in isolation, but in interdependence. Ask: - What does \u201clocal\u201d mean in your context? - If everyone had work, what would they be doing? - What resources are wasted, overlooked, or underused? Commitment Vouchers: Lecture & Dialogue (30 min) \u00b6 Invite participants to reflect together: \u201cShillings are issued by the state\u2014but what if we created a trust ledger of our own? One where our word was enough to begin trade?\u201d A voucher is a promise: \u201cI will provide X when you redeem this.\u201d It is not backed by money\u2014but by commitment . Pools allow these promises to be circulated and swapped. Their strength comes from redemption and memory\u2014not profit or enforcement. Say: \u201cToday, we will experience a system where care is tracked, promises are fulfilled, and value is remembered. This is not charity. It is not aid. It is coordination.\u201d Then ask these questions to prompt discussion: Have you ever thought about where money comes from? What would it mean to create a credit system based on care? Do businesses in the community experience cash flow problems? How is a voucher different from national currency? How do people currently borrow value\u2014and at what cost? Formal (banks, SACCOs, MFIs)? Informal (friends, shop credit, shylocks)? How long does it take to access credit? What are the conditions or consequences? Exercise: Mapping Our Promise Ecosystem \u00b6 Materials \u00b6 White Board or Flipchart Markers Slips of paper (white for needs, blue for offerings) Beans or tokens to represent Community Vouchers (e.g. 10 CAV per bean) Pens or pencils Tape or wall for posting Setup \u00b6 Give each participant: 1 A4 sheet of paper 6 white slips (to write community needs) 10 beans (representing vouchers they may issue or receive) A pencil or pen Introduction \u00b6 Say: \u201cTo make a healthy Commitment Pool, we need to understand what value flows through our community. Who can offer what? Who needs what? This is not just about business\u2014it includes care, joy, labor, and repair.\u201d \u201cMost Community Vouchers today are digital\u2014but for this session, we will simulate using beans and paper. This makes the entire trust system visible and traceable.\u201d Step 1: Mapping Needs \u00b6 Ask: \u201cWhat are the unmet needs in your community? Think of goods like food and fuel, services like transport or repair, and care like grief support or elder care.\u201d Write 2\u20133 needs per person. Collect and post them on the board. Mark repeated entries with stars. Ask: Which of these needs require imports? Which could be fulfilled locally? Which are currently unpaid or underpaid? Are there any circular flows\u2014needs that could be met through internal trade? Use metaphors to illustrate impact: \u201cWhat happens to a leaking bucket?\u201d \u201cIf we import more than we create, our wealth flows out. But if we promise, fulfill, and cycle trust internally\u2014our bucket stays full.\u201d This first part prepares the ground for the next: issuing promises and simulating swaps. When you're ready, I\u2019ll help rewrite Part 2 with swap exercises and Commitment Pool flow. Step 2. What Can I Promise? \u00b6 Say: Now that we\u2019ve explored what our community needs, let\u2019s reflect on what each of us can offer. Not necessarily what you sell for money, but what you are willing to promise\u2014your labor, your goods, your time, your care. A commitment does not have to be something you currently have in your pocket. It can be something you\u2019re able to produce, do, or give in the future. That\u2019s the nature of a promise. Each slip of paper represents a voucher \u2014a formal promise you are making to your community. Write down one commitment per paper. Try to be realistic. What would you feel good about fulfilling if someone brought that paper back to you? Instructions: Give each person 4 slips of paper . Have them write one offer per slip (e.g. \u201c1 plate of food\u201d, \u201c1 hour tutoring\u201d, \u201c10 eggs\u201d, \u201crepair bike\u201d, etc.). These are their personal issued vouchers \u2014which will later be part of their Own Held commitments. Optional framing: These slips are like IOUs\u2014but shared in a system that remembers. When we pool them together, we create a shared memory of what care exists and who has promised it. Step 3. Seeding and Swapping Commitments \u00b6 In this activity, we will simulate how a Commitment Pool works. Participants will seed their promises into a shared pool and then use those pooled commitments to meet their needs. Say: In a real commitment pool, people seed their promises into a shared trust registry. This allows others to draw on those promises\u2014not based on money, but on reciprocal care. For today\u2019s exercise, we\u2019ll use beans to represent commitments that have been seeded into the pool . Each bean equals a promise worth 10 CAVs \u2014a voucher denomination of your choosing. We are not \u201cearning money\u201d\u2014we are routing trust . Setup: Give each participant 10 beans . These represent 100 CAV worth of pooled credit. Remind them: they are receiving this not as a gift , but as temporary access to the pool , based on mutual trust. Pricing: Now look at the vouchers you wrote earlier. On the back, write a price for each promise\u2014in 10-CAV units (e.g. 10, 20, 30, etc.). Keep it small so your peers can afford multiple swaps. When someone trades a bean for your voucher, they now hold your promise and may return it to you later for redemption. Demonstration: Hold up one of your own offers (e.g. \u201c1 Boda ride\u201d) and say: \u201cThis is my promise. It costs 50 CAVs, or 5 beans. If someone gives me 5 beans, they receive this voucher\u2014and can later return it to me to claim the ride.\u201d Instructions: Now, you may walk around and make trades. Give someone beans to receive a voucher. Or offer your vouchers in exchange for beans. You must make at least five trades . Try to meet your real needs based on what others are offering. This is not about profit\u2014it\u2019s about circulation and trust. Once you've completed your trades, sit down and count your beans and vouchers. We\u2019ll do a memory check together. Debrief (after everyone finishes): Gather participants and ask: How many beans do you have left? How many vouchers from others do you now hold? How many of your own vouchers did others receive? Who are you now in trust with ? How would you feel if someone brought your voucher back tomorrow to redeem? Close with: This is how a pool begins: promises are seeded, exchanged, and remembered. If you fulfill what you\u2019ve promised, the cycle is sustained. If memory or redemption breaks down, so does trust. This is a metabolic economy\u2014not a market. Step 4. Community Trust Audit \u00b6 Set up a chart on the board with everyone\u2019s name. This is our trust memory for the session. Say: Let\u2019s trace what happened in our trust flow. Each bean represented a pooled promise. Now we\u2019ll see who has given more than they received, and who has received more than they gave. Please count how many beans (pooled promises) you have. If you think you have the most, say the amount out loud. One by one, we\u2019ll write the names and totals on the board, from most to least. Write each participant\u2019s final bean total next to their name on a large board or flipchart. Group Reflection \u00b6 Ask: What do you notice about the distribution? Who ended up with more pooled credit than they started with? Who ended up with less? Explain: In this simulation, each person started with 10 beans, or 100 CAV worth of shared promise access. Someone who ends up with 15 beans now holds more pooled trust\u2014they\u2019ve contributed more than they\u2019ve drawn. Someone with 5 beans has drawn more from the pool than they\u2019ve offered in return\u2014this is not a failure, but a signal. It may reflect need, timing, or trust routing. Ask: What could the group do to support the people whose offers weren\u2019t picked up? What happens if someone consistently gives but doesn\u2019t spend? What if someone receives many promises but doesn\u2019t fulfill their own? Listen for responses like: Broadening who\u2019s invited into the pool Changing what\u2019s seeded into the pool Supporting fulfillment capacity Encouraging new trust ties Trade Pattern Review \u00b6 Next, tally what types of offers were fulfilled. This will help the group see the metabolic patterns of the ecosystem. Ask participants to raise hands for what they received , or collect the redeemed vouchers. Create a table like this on the board: Offer Type Total Traded (CAV) # of Trades External Input? Boda Ride 200 2 Water 200 2 Chapati (Food) 400 4 Tomatoes 0 0 Petrol 200 2 Yes Use a star (*) to mark anything that requires external resupply (like petrol). Guided Questions: \u00b6 What patterns do we see in what was traded? What offers were never redeemed? Why might that be? Which offers depend on external goods (Kenyan Shillings)? Can this ecosystem sustain itself? What would help? Then ask: Were daily needs met through the pool? What needs are missing from this exchange? What challenges showed up during this exercise? Facilitator notes: Write down issues the group mentions\u2014these often include: Supply bottlenecks (especially for external goods) Trust gaps or misunderstandings Too few people in the pool Changing prices without agreement Over-concentration of CAV with a few participants Limited redemption points or poor circulation Seasonal gaps (e.g. harvest-dependent goods) Final Prompt: Remember: Commitment Pooling is a collective memory. It\u2019s not just about how much we each gave or received, but whether our shared metabolism is thriving. If people are hoarding promises, losing track, or unable to fulfill\u2014then we adjust the pool. Trust doesn\u2019t disappear\u2014it just needs to be rerouted. Part 2. Creating a Community Asset Voucher through Commitment Pooling \u00b6 In the previous simulation, you may have wondered: What happens if I end up holding too many CAVs? These are important questions. Here are some you might hear: \u201cHow will I restock my shop with goods that can only be bought with Kenyan Shillings?\u201d \ud83d\udc49 Accept CAV in proportion to what you can redeem for in the pool. \ud83d\udc49 Accept as much as you\u2019re comfortable holding as trust in your community. \u201cWhat if people spend CAV, then refuse to accept them back?\u201d \ud83d\udc49 Those who issue vouchers must fulfill them. If not, mediation is required. This section helps us practice the core principle of Commitment Pooling : No CAV exists without a real commitment behind it. Every voucher is backed by a specific person or group, promising goods or services. Introducing a CAV isn\u2019t just technical\u2014it\u2019s relational. Pooling our commitments is an act of trust and care. That trust must be continually refreshed and fulfilled. Commitment Pooling: Lecture & Discussion (30 mins) \u00b6 Facilitator notes: Provide pens and paper for notes. Say: Every CAV begins as a voucher of trust \u2014a promise to offer something of real value to your neighbors. That promise is what we call a commitment . In the simulation, each person was issued 100 CAV because they were backing it with 100 Ksh of actual value\u2014vegetables, transport, tailoring, childcare. If someone spent 100 CAV on tomatoes while promising shoe repair\u2014they\u2019re pre-selling their service for tomatoes. This is how reciprocal value flows. Core Principles to Emphasize \u00b6 Community Backing : > Every voucher must be redeemable. If you issue 2,000 CAV, you must be ready to redeem it with 2,000 Ksh worth of real goods or services. Zero Trade Balance Target : > Over time, communities aim for each member\u2019s CAV issued (debt) to match the CAV redeemed (fulfilled). Reserve of Commitments : > Think of commitments like seeds in a seed bank. You deposit a promise, receive a voucher (like a share slip), and later, someone else redeems it. Ongoing Care : > A CAV is not free money. It is a living memory of trust that must be nourished. If people issue but refuse to fulfill, the circulation stops. Resentment grows. The system fails. \ud83c\udf31 Exercise: Community Commitment Pledging \u00b6 This activity will help you map what your community can actually commit \u2014in real time and value. Participants will declare: - What they can offer - How much they are willing to redeem - What they expect to spend - What limits they want to set \ud83e\uddf0 Materials \u00b6 4 white slips of paper per participant (to write voucher types) Beans or slips to represent CAV (at least 25 per participant, = 2,500 Ksh of backing) Pens or pencils A4 paper for commitment summaries Flipchart paper for public commitment board \ud83c\udf00 Setup \u00b6 Stay in the same groups from the previous round. Distribute materials. Choose roles: \ud83d\udc65 Roles \u00b6 Chama Representative / Pool Steward : Audit the commitments: Are they realistic? Do they reflect real capacity? Allocate vouchers (CAV) based on the commitments. Mediate disputes. Enforce a 2% monthly holding fee (if used). Naming Your CAV \u00b6 Say: Let\u2019s choose a name and abbreviation for your community\u2019s voucher. It can be playful, aspirational, or local. For example: \u201cWanoma\u201d \u2192 \u201cNOMA\u201d. Give each group 5 minutes to choose a name and abbreviation. Share and vote for a favorite. Write it prominently on the board. This becomes the unit of promise in your pool. How Many CAVs to Create? \u00b6 Each CAV must be backed 100% by actual, auditable commitments. This means: Each participant writes up to 2,500 Ksh of realistic goods and services they are willing to redeem. The pool steward checks: Does this reflect real monthly or seasonal capacity? Sum all commitments. That\u2019s the pool reserve . Total CAV that can be issued = Pool Reserve. Facilitator: Emphasize that no CAV is created from thin air. Only commitments generate CAV. Community Creation Criteria \u00b6 To form a live Commitment Pool: Group must be at least 1 year old Minimum 10 active members At least 50,000 Ksh worth of verifiable backing Participation in this training Signed agreement, validated by elders and leaders Say: This is serious. A CAV is not a project. It\u2019s a promise system. Like a child, it needs care and guidance. Communities that treat their promises with care can build long-term economic trust. Discussion Prompts \u00b6 Ask the group: Did we reach the 50,000 Ksh mark? Were the commitments balanced? If not, who else might join to strengthen the pool? Do you see potential for circular trade\u2014where promises can fulfill each other locally? What commitments felt easy to make? What felt risky? Would seeing others\u2019 numbers influence what you offered? What would make this process more fair or effective? How should this commitment agreement be enforced? Who will mediate disputes or trust breakdowns? \ud83d\udd0d Reflective Prompt \u00b6 Say: Think back to the earlier simulation. You held vouchers, you traded, you tracked value. Now ask yourself: What could you commit in the real world? Vegetables? Plumbing? A week of childcare? Now, make those real. Write down up to 2,500 Ksh of actual services or goods you\u2019d offer if your community launched this voucher tomorrow. Remind them: Your total CAV allocation = your total commitment. Don\u2019t offer more than you\u2019re willing to redeem. Facilitator: Gather these cards and post the total pool capacity publicly. By the end of this section, your group will have: \u2705 A proposed CAV name \u2705 A list of committed goods and services \u2705 A total backing amount \u2705 Roles assigned \u2705 An understanding of what it means to seed , hold , and fulfill a commitment This is the metabolic seed of your community economy. \ud83e\uddf7 Step 1: Naming Your Commitments \u00b6 Facilitator: Remind the group of the previous CAV simulation. Say: Earlier, you committed goods or services in order to receive CAV. This is exactly how a voucher becomes valid\u2014it must be backed by a real promise to fulfill something useful. Now, we\u2019ll do this with actual commitments from each of you. We\u2019re going to simulate a real Commitment Pool: Each person will back 2,500 KSH worth of goods or services and receive 2,500 CAV. In a real launch, the group must reach at least 50,000 KSH in audited commitments, and no single person should commit more than 10% of their annual (or one month\u2019s) business capacity. So: What can you honestly promise to provide to your community\u2014redeemable by anyone holding your voucher? Give each participant 25 small slips of paper. Say: Write one item or service per slip. If you\u2019re offering chapati, write that on each slip. Write the value\u2014e.g., \u201cChapati - 100 KSH\u201d on each one. These slips represent your actual, redeemable commitments. \u2705 Goal: Each participant ends with 2,500 KSH worth of committed goods or services, documented as 25 slips at 100 KSH each. \ud83d\udcca Step 2: Fill in the Commitment Table \u00b6 Facilitator: As participants complete their slips, transcribe each commitment into a Commitment Table on a flipchart or board. Commitment Table Format: Name Product Committed Commitment Value (KSH) CAV Issued Joyce Water 400 400 Janet Sugar 400 400 Jacob Maize flour 400 400 Mwanaidi Rice 400 400 Phred Phone airtime 400 400 Amina Firewood (Kuni) 400 400 Mbui Maji 400 400 Vivian Boda rides 400 400 Njambi Greens (Mboga) 400 400 Nadzua Water project 400 400 Total 4,000 4,000 Say: This is our Commitment Table . It shows who promised what\u2014and how much CAV they will receive in return. Every voucher is a receipt of a promise, and this table is our collective memory. For example, if Sally commits 2,500 KSH of chapatis, she will receive 2,500 CAV. Later, when someone redeems those vouchers, she will fulfill that promise. Facilitator Tip: Emphasize that promises are traceable . No one can issue CAV anonymously. Ask: Any questions on this process? Would someone like to act as the Pool Steward or Chama Rep\u2014responsible for validating and maintaining this registry? \ud83c\udf9f\ufe0f Step 3: Issue Vouchers (CAVs) \u00b6 Appoint the Pool Steward to audit and distribute. Say: Let\u2019s issue vouchers into our shared trust pool. The Pool Steward will inspect each person\u2019s commitments to ensure they are realistic. Once verified, that person will be issued 1 bean (or paper slip) per 100 KSH of value. Example: A participant committing 2,500 KSH will receive 25 beans , each worth 100 CAV. Calculate the group total: With [N] participants \u00d7 2,500 KSH each, our total seeded commitment is: [N \u00d7 2,500] KSH . We will issue [N \u00d7 2,500] CAV into circulation. Facilitator: We now have a functioning seed pool of commitments. Every voucher issued is matched by a promise that lives here, in this room. \u2705 Next, we will simulate how those commitments flow, are swapped, and ultimately redeemed. Up next: Step 4 \u2013 Redemption and Trust Maintenance , or let me know if you'd like to go deeper on enforcement and mediation! \ud83d\udd01 Step 4: Trust Flow Simulation \u2014 Trading Rounds \u00b6 Facilitator: Now we\u2019ll simulate a trust-flow environment. You\u2019ve each seeded your commitments and received CAV vouchers. You\u2019re now participants in a metabolically active pool\u2014each transaction is a routing of trust. Instructions: Perform 5 rounds of mutual swaps using your vouchers. The Pool Steward (Chama Rep) does not trade in this round\u2014they observe and later collect the holding tax. After trading, collect final voucher balances and build a summary table: \ud83e\uddfe Voucher Balances After 5 Trades \u00b6 Agent Wanoma (CAV Held) Mwanaidi 1000 Amina 800 Njambi 600 Jacob 600 Mbui 400 Janet 200 Nadzua 200 Phred 100 Joy 100 Viv 0 Total 4000 Discuss with the group: What does this pattern tell us about how trust was routed in the community? Which agents have surplus trust flows (high voucher holdings)? Which agents are in trade deficit? What might happen if these balances remained static over time? \u2705 This is the metabolic pulse of the local economy: voucher surpluses reflect unreciprocated commitments; deficits reflect high fulfillment. \ud83d\udcb8 Step 5: Holding Tax Simulation (Expiration Rate) \u00b6 Facilitator: To keep promises circulating and discourage hoarding, we apply a small holding tax\u2014this prevents stagnation in the pool and funds community stewardship. Instructions: The Pool Steward collects 1 bean (100 CAV) for every 10 beans held. This represents a 10% holding tax for the simulation (equal to ~2% per month over 6 months). Round down when necessary. \ud83e\uddfe Post-Tax Balances \u00b6 Agent CAV Held Holding Tax (6 months) Mwanaidi 1000 100 Amina 800 80 Njambi 600 60 Jacob 600 60 Mbui 400 40 Janet 200 20 Nadzua 200 20 Phred 100 10 Joy 100 10 Viv 0 0 Total 4000 400 \ud83e\udde0 Group Reflection: \u00b6 What does this tax mechanism do to trust flow? How could the Pool Steward use the 400 CAV collected? Support village elders? Fund community projects? Maintain pool software or steward facilitation? Does it feel fair? What if the pool was 50,000 CAV and collected 1,000 per month in tax? Would that be sustainable? \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Optional Role-Based Simulations \u00b6 If time allows, try adding roles for more complex simulation: An elder with no ability to trade, but still given CAV. A rogue actor trying to exit the pool with more than they offer. An issuer who refuses redemption. A project manager who misroutes resources. After each round, reflect on: What happened to trust in the pool? Was it traceable? How did the group respond? \ud83c\udf0d Part 3: Introducing CAVs to the Community and Beyond \u00b6 \u26a0\ufe0f Understanding the Risks \u00b6 A CAV is not a store of value\u2014it\u2019s a living promise. If hoarded, it dies. If circulated, it feeds the system. Example Risk: - A shopkeeper sells all her imported stock for CAV and can\u2019t restock\u2014why? No one backed those goods. - Solution: Limit CAV acceptance to what you can redeem locally. \ud83d\udcdc Commitments Are Obligations \u00b6 Each voucher must be matched by trust and care. If people issue and then refuse redemption, the pool collapses. Ask: - Who in your group do you deeply trust to fulfill? - Who might need community accountability? - How will the pool maintain memory of fulfillment or breach? \u2696\ufe0f Dispute Resolution (Redemption Enforcement) \u00b6 Refusing redemption = breaking a promise. Your CAV Commitment Agreement must outline consequences. Questions to guide discussion: Who resolves disputes? Are elders, stewards, or a mediation circle involved? How will breach records be tracked? \ud83e\uddef Worst-Case Scenarios \u00b6 Explore and discuss: A vendor sells all stock for CAV but cannot restock (needed shillings). A CAV is spent but not redeemed for months. Someone manipulates the system to dump excess CAV on others. A community backer spends their CAV in a different region. Project funds are unfairly distributed by corrupt management. Prompt the group: - What protection or fallback could we design? - Would pooling or arbitration help? - What commitments are needed to guard the commons of trust? \ud83e\uddee Balancing Inventory in a Commitment Pool \u00b6 In a Commitment Pool system, every voucher represents a live promise to accept and fulfill. For businesses\u2014especially those not issuing their own vouchers\u2014the key question is: \u201cIf I accept this voucher (CAV), where will I route it? Can I use it to restock, meet needs, or reduce my own expenses?\u201d For Issuers \u00b6 You start with a bundle of promises (vouchers). Your duty is to fulfill those promises when others return them to you. Your freedom is that you can spend as long as you honor redemption. Spend \u2192 Be Redeemed \u2192 Repeat For Non-Issuers \u00b6 Your trust is limited by what you know you can spend back into the network . Accept only as much as you can route forward or offset in local expenses . Guidelines for Inventory Balancing \u00b6 Routeable Redemption If you're asked to accept vouchers, ask: Can I use this voucher to meet my needs? If not, the issuer should show you where or how it can be spent\u2014especially within the issuer\u2019s own network. Margin-Limited Acceptance Accept vouchers in proportion to: Your profit margin on goods requiring national currency to restock. What you'd otherwise offer as informal store credit . Network Enrichment Invite your suppliers, landlords, or employees into the pool. That expands where your received vouchers can flow. \ud83e\uddea Exercise: Metabolic Inventory Simulation \u00b6 Roleplay a trader with goods that cannot be restocked in CAV (e.g., Coca-Cola): Buy Price: KSh 20 Sell Price: KSh 40 Stock Frequency: Monthly CAV Target: Save enough CAV to offset other purchases (like food) Ask: \u00b6 How many CAV can you use daily in the community? How much CAV can you safely accept per bottle sold? Would you price differently in vouchers vs. shillings? What happens to local alternatives when voucher circulation grows? Does this shift reduce dependency on imports? Key Takeaway: \u00b6 \ud83d\udca1 Balancing means ensuring that every voucher accepted can offset a real expense or be rerouted to another trusted redemption point. \ud83c\udf0d External Support in a Commitment Pool \u00b6 In a Commitment Pool, vouchers (CAVs) can be pre-purchased and distributed\u2014this is not a donation, but a prepayment of trust . How Support Works: \u00b6 Humanitarian actors or individuals can purchase CAVs from issuers. These vouchers are then gifted to community members in need. Because vouchers must be redeemable, the act strengthens local business instead of displacing it. Why It\u2019s Better: \u00b6 Ensures local fulfillment : Only those promising services get pre-funding. Creates a voucher multiplier : The same voucher can circulate many times before final redemption. A pre-purchased voucher funds trust\u2014not dependency. Consider: \u00b6 Which NGOs, government bodies, or programs align with your pool\u2019s goals? What external actors might prepay for local services as part of their mandate? \ud83e\ude9e Reflections: Governance & Community Trust \u00b6 Inspired by Elinor Ostrom\u2019s Commons Principles , use these to discuss with your group: Who is in the Pool? Are the membership boundaries clear and inclusive? Are Rules Local? Do usage and issuance rules reflect your community\u2019s reality? Who Sets the Rules? Can members participate in shaping policies? Is the Pool Respected Externally? Can authorities recognize your governance? How is Trust Tracked? Do you track fulfillment, redemption, and imbalances over time? What Happens in Conflict? Is there a shared process for resolving voucher disputes? What\u2019s the Governance Structure? Do you have nested layers\u2014from small groups to the broader ecosystem? \u2705 Next Steps \u00b6 Review the CAV FAQ & Quiz . Ensure your Chama meets Commitment Pool criteria. Finalize your CAV Commitment Agreement. Email: info@grassecon.org Phone: +254 757 628885 Once approved, begin seeding, swapping, redeeming\u2014and tracking your pool\u2019s metabolic flow. \ud83d\udcdd Appendix: Best Practices for Pool Design \u00b6 Internal Trust Structures \u00b6 Vision & Purpose : Does your group agree on why you exist? Needs Mapping : What goods/services are most vital in your network? Stakeholder Relations : Who are your suppliers, clients, and allies? Issuance Logic : How is CAV distributed or loaned, and to whom? Redemption Ethics : How are obligations enforced or tracked? Cycle Management : Is there a reset or reconciliation period (monthly, quarterly)? Market Days : When and where do trust flows get rebalanced communally? Balance Caps : Are holding limits or swap eligibility tied to seeding history? \ud83d\udca7 Example: Water Project \u00b6 Input : 5000 liters of water \u2192 Cost: KSh 3,000 Output : 250 jerricans \u2192 Sell for KSh 15 + 5 CAV Revenue: KSh 3,750 + 1250 CAV Cost: KSh 3,000 Net: 750 KSh profit + 1250 CAV to be rerouted or redeemed. Wage Distribution Example : Role % Share KSh CAV Quality Check (Sally) 20% 150 250 Worker (Mbui) 30% 225 375 Chama Fund 50% 375 625 \ud83e\uddf1 Project-Backed Pools \u00b6 Instead of individual commitments, a pool may be backed by a community project \u2014e.g., a food kitchen, borehole, or public transport route. \u26a0\ufe0f This requires more rigorous audit and long-term redemption planning. Trust must be equally distributed between the issuing project and the people holding its promises. \ud83c\udfaf Design Prompt for Group Work \u00b6 In small groups, ask: What are your community\u2019s top unmet needs? What projects could meet those needs? How could these projects be trusted to fulfill CAV redemptions? Conclude by surfacing the shared purpose of the pool and key projects to fund through issuance. \ud83d\udcac \u201cWhen we create a CAV, we aren\u2019t just issuing currency\u2014we are seeding trust.\u201d","title":"Training Guide"},{"location":"edu/training/#commitment-pooling-community-vouchers-a-field-guide","text":"","title":"Commitment Pooling &amp; Community Vouchers: A Field Guide"},{"location":"edu/training/#how-to-use-this-guide","text":"This guide is designed to give communities a feel for how Community Asset Vouchers (CAVs) function within a Commitment Pooling ecosystem.

Used well, it supports livelihoods, anchors collective projects, and builds economic resilience. Like any system of care, it requires maintenance. If promises go unfulfilled or memory breaks down, harm can occur. This guide models how such breakdowns happen\u2014and how communities can prevent them by tending their pool with care.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"edu/training/#history","text":"Before coins, before states, before banks\u2014there was trust.

A voucher like \u201c10 eggs\u201d or \u201c1 hour of childcare\u201d can circulate before national currency arrives.

Instead, we want to map a diverse metabolic network : - What kinds of value can circulate? - What goods and services are abundant? - What leaks out (imports)? - What can be redirected or reimagined? This mapping helps communities shape trust routes and prepare for full-cycle redemption. It also reveals whether they can become self-reliant \u2014not in isolation, but in interdependence.

Not necessarily what you sell for money, but what you are willing to promise\u2014your labor, your goods, your time, your care. A commitment does not have to be something you currently have in your pocket. It can be something you\u2019re able to produce, do, or give in the future. That\u2019s the nature of a promise.

Participants will seed their promises into a shared pool and then use those pooled commitments to meet their needs. Say: In a real commitment pool, people seed their promises into a shared trust registry. This allows others to draw on those promises\u2014not based on money, but on reciprocal care. For today\u2019s exercise, we\u2019ll use beans to represent commitments that have been seeded into the pool . Each bean equals a promise worth 10 CAVs \u2014a voucher denomination of your choosing. We are not \u201cearning money\u201d\u2014we are routing trust . Setup: Give each participant 10 beans . These represent 100 CAV worth of pooled credit. Remind them: they are receiving this not as a gift , but as temporary access to the pool , based on mutual trust. Pricing: Now look at the vouchers you wrote earlier. On the back, write a price for each promise\u2014in 10-CAV units (e.g. 10, 20, 30, etc.). Keep it small so your peers can afford multiple swaps. When someone trades a bean for your voucher, they now hold your promise and may return it to you later for redemption. Demonstration: Hold up one of your own offers (e.g. \u201c1 Boda ride\u201d) and say: \u201cThis is my promise. It costs 50 CAVs, or 5 beans. If someone gives me 5 beans, they receive this voucher\u2014and can later return it to me to claim the ride.\u201d Instructions: Now, you may walk around and make trades. Give someone beans to receive a voucher. Or offer your vouchers in exchange for beans. You must make at least five trades . Try to meet your real needs based on what others are offering. This is not about profit\u2014it\u2019s about circulation and trust. Once you've completed your trades, sit down and count your beans and vouchers. We\u2019ll do a memory check together. Debrief (after everyone finishes): Gather participants and ask: How many beans do you have left? How many vouchers from others do you now hold? How many of your own vouchers did others receive? Who are you now in trust with ? How would you feel if someone brought your voucher back tomorrow to redeem? Close with: This is how a pool begins: promises are seeded, exchanged, and remembered.

INTRODUCTION \u00b6 About the Programme Quality Toolkit \u00b6 The Commitment Pool Protocol (CP) is a regenerative alternative to conventional market coordination. It helps communities record, exchange, and fulfill promises of future contributions \u2014 such as food, care, labor, or service \u2014 in a way that builds trust and resilience. Unlike extractive economic systems, Commitment Pooling centers on relational accountability and a memory of care. This toolkit offers practical guidance to implement a CP project, covering all stages of the project cycle: Preparedness Assessment Response Analysis Setup and Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation It supports communities, facilitators, and humanitarian teams to co-create their own pools of commitments \u2014 increasing local economic activity, reducing unmet needs, and routing trust where it is most needed. How to Use the PQT \u00b6 This toolkit is relevant across different phases of response: Preparedness : Identifying dormant skills and goods that could be made exchangeable via commitments. Emergency : Coordinating rapid mutual aid while reducing cash dependency. Early Recovery : Weaving promise networks after disruption, before currency or logistics return. Development : Supporting self-reliant economies with long-term trust structures. What the Toolkit Is \u00b6 A practical guide to organizing Commitment Pools , rooted in protocols piloted across Kenya. A supplement to CVA and humanitarian cash tools, particularly where liquidity is scarce or systems of trust are needed. An adaptable framework \u2014 grounded in regenerative economics \u2014 rather than a fixed template. What the Toolkit Is Not \u00b6 It is not a digital currency guide or fiat-replacement system. It does not assume a universal implementation strategy \u2014 contexts vary. It does not require high technology \u2014 paper-based, verbal, or simple apps can support CP logic. Toolkit Uses \u00b6 Guide the full lifecycle of a CP project. Dive directly into specific modules as needed. Use tools/templates in day-to-day facilitation. Draw on the appendices for further resources. Target Audience \u00b6 Primary Audience: - Humanitarian implementers supporting regenerative coordination. - Innovation teams piloting CVA+CP hybrid models. Broader Audience: - Social enterprises - Community-based organizations - Village savings & loan associations (VSLA) - Local governments & municipal actors - Ethical tech providers - Researchers in care economies Toolkit Origins and Development \u00b6 This PQT draws from real-world implementation in Mukuru and Kisauni (Kenya) with KRCS and Grassroots Economics Foundation. These pilots tested CPs in contexts of post-COVID economic strain, livelihood rebuilding, and social cohesion work. This document was co-developed with field actors, researchers, and community leaders \u2014 evolving with their input, observations, and lived experiences. It remains a living document : feedback, adaptation, and new use cases are welcomed and encouraged. Toolkit Structure Overview \u00b6 The toolkit is structured around five core modules , each aligned to the phases of a regenerative economic project: Orientation to Commitment Pooling What is a commitment? What is a pool? Why pools route trust more effectively than fiat injections. Preparedness Mapping community capacities. Establishing pool boundaries and seeding preconditions. Preparing for valuation and curation of commitments. Assessment & Stakeholder Alignment Identifying underutilized skills or goods. Building local trust in shared memory systems. Conducting baseline evaluations and consent processes. Implementation Seeding, swapping, and fulfilling commitments. Organizing local gatherings to deepen engagement. Coordinating cross-pool swaps or federations. Monitoring & Relational Evaluation Are trust relationships growing? What commitments remain unfulfilled? Are redemption and participation equitable? INTRODUCTION TO COMMITMENT POOLING \u00b6 About Commitment Pooling \u00b6 This module introduces the core concept of Commitment Pooling : a regenerative economic practice in which community members make, track, and fulfill promises to one another \u2014 not as products, but as commitments. These promises are represented by vouchers , which circulate in a shared pool , enabling communities to coordinate trust, reciprocity, and future contributions. The module outlines core concepts, legal frameworks (like Nondominium agreements), and essential support systems such as Core Service Providers (CSPs), who maintain the tools, training, and records of these trust-based economies. Case Study \u2013 Binguni & Mbele in Kenya \u00b6 Real-world examples from Kenya illustrate how communities reoriented economic exchange around trust, future service, and communal value rather than currency. \ud83d\udcd6 Read the case study PREPAREDNESS \u00b6 Organisational Preparedness \u00b6 Implementing a Commitment Pool begins with assessing readiness . This includes understanding the local ecosystem of trust, labor, unmet needs, and existing economic activity. Conduct a landscape review of: - History of shocks and recovery efforts - Legal frameworks (data, arbitration, fiscal governance) - Infrastructure and digital readiness - Social cohesion and governance structures - Existing support services (financial literacy, IGAs) Gather both secondary and primary data, including: - National/local government publications - Humanitarian and development sector reports - Beneficiary surveys and economic capacity assessments - Training on Data Protection & PSEA (See Appendix) Self-Assessment: Commitment Pool Implementation Readiness \u00b6 Implementing organisations should hold a facilitated internal workshop to assess and align on four key areas of readiness: Thematic Area Focus Questions 1. Enabling Systems Do we have agreements in place to join a Clearing Union or act as a CSP? Are our technical tools (wallets, ledgers) ready to handle pooled commitments? 2. Programme Tools Do we understand how to seed, swap, redeem, and track fulfillment? Are our teams trained in the Commitment Pool protocol? 3. Resources & Capacity Do we have facilitators, mediators, and trainers for trust-based exchange? Can we support Issuing Groups to grow capacity? 4. Communication & Coordination Are local stakeholders (faith leaders, CBOs, women\u2019s groups) engaged? Are communities ready to issue and hold vouchers based on their contributions? Organisational Self-Assessment Process \u00b6 Step Activities 1. Assemble Key Stakeholders Bring together staff across technical, management, and community-facing roles 2. Plan Workshop Schedule a 1\u20132 day workshop with a facilitator familiar with Commitment Pooling 3. Conduct Workshop Score preparedness, discuss gaps, visualize results, co-design solutions 4. Draft Plan of Action (PoA) Prioritize actions, secure leadership approval, and integrate into program plans Programmatic Preparedness \u00b6 Legal Framework \u00b6 A Commitment Pool operates as part of a Fiscal Commons , often governed by a Nondominium agreement \u2014 a legal innovation enabling shared custodianship of a resource without private ownership. Key components include: - Clearing Union (CU) : Open commons agreement for voucher-based exchange - Core Service Provider (CSP) : Manages technical tools, offers training, and provides arbitration - General Members (GMs) : Community groups and individuals who seed and redeem commitments - Service Agreements : Outline how GMs and CSPs interact (e.g., fees, governance, redemptions) \ud83d\udd17 More on Nondominium Feasibility Study for a Commitment Pool \u00b6 Before launching, conduct a feasibility study to evaluate: - General CVA context in the region (if running hybrid models) - Community readiness to make and track commitments - Local acceptance and understanding of trust-based systems - Market capacity to absorb and redeem vouchers - Political openness and legal environment Data collection methods : - Key informant interviews (local authorities, market leaders) - Focus group discussions (potential issuers and holders) - Field visits (to assess tradable goods/services) - Stakeholder mapping (to identify pool entry-points) Commitment Pool Implementation Checklist \u00b6 [ ] Do we have trained facilitators for workshops and onboarding? [ ] Are we legally able to hold and support voucher systems (e.g. cUSD, hours, goods)? [ ] Have we secured a service agreement with a trusted Core Service Provider? [ ] Are our targeted Issuing Groups ready to seed promises into the pool? [ ] Have we assessed whether their commitments are reliable and redeemable? [ ] Can we support local production (e.g., IGAs, gardens, labor pools) to match voucher flow? [ ] Is our digital or paper-based ledger system secure, accessible, and trusted? This preparedness phase ensures that both the relational infrastructure (trust, memory, agreements) and the technical infrastructure (ledgers, training, pooling tools) are in place before launch. The process helps root Commitment Pooling in lived community practice \u2014 not as an intervention from above, but as a regenerative grammar of mutual aid and interdependence. CONDUCTING BENEFIT AND RISK ANALYSIS FOR COMMITMENT POOLS \u00b6 This section outlines how to identify and address risks related to the implementation of Commitment Pooling networks. These include relational, technical, regulatory, and operational risks related to both voucher-based trust systems and the institutions supporting them. Risk Identification and Ranking \u00b6 Each risk should be mapped across categories, identifying: - Cause (source of uncertainty) - Effect (potential disruption) - Mitigation (reliable fallback or design fix) Where Commitment Pools are layered with other humanitarian programs (e.g. CVA), integration risks should be analyzed distinctly from Pooling-specific risks. Risk Categories & Sample Questions \u00b6 Risk Type Key Considerations Social Risk Will the pool remain viable if large debts accumulate? Can seeding and redemption continue without centralized liquidity? Technical Risk If a Core Service Provider (CSP) goes offline, can participants still view balances and redeem commitments? Are ledgers distributed or hosted centrally? Regulatory Risk Could voucher-based systems be affected by new digital asset regulations? Are pool structures compliant with non-bank obligations? Political Risk Do local/national governments recognize trust-based community exchange systems? Are pools viewed as solidarity infrastructure or informal finance? Exit Risk If CSP support ends, can the voucher system operate peer-to-peer? Can agreements persist in paper or offline forms? Is knowledge embedded locally? Risks should be scored using a likelihood \u00d7 impact matrix (see Appendix). Mitigation Strategies \u00b6 Use distributed ledgers and paper vouchers to increase resilience Build redundant local CSP networks to prevent central points of failure Use service agreements (CUA, CUMA) to guarantee exit pathways and long-term accountability Promote multi-stakeholder governance via Guardians and community assemblies Regularly rotate and train local validators to hold memory and operational capacity MAPPING EXISTING ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS \u00b6 To strengthen alignment and sustainability, map all existing programs that could integrate with or benefit from a Commitment Pool: Income Generation Projects \u2192 link to seeding capacity Livelihood Support \u2192 redeemable promises in goods/labor Training Programs \u2192 capacity-building for issuers Cash Transfers \u2192 could be converted into stable vouchers for internal trade Pooling may absorb and metabolize these external supports more effectively if they are routed through shared community agreements and ledger tracking. STAKEHOLDER MAPPING AND ENGAGEMENT \u00b6 Stakeholders include: - Local governments - Religious and cultural leaders - Community groups and cooperatives - NGOs running adjacent CVA, livelihood, or food programs - Tech providers or civil society alliances Use the Stakeholder Engagement Guide (see Appendix) to: - Identify roles and spheres of influence - Choose engagement methods and frequency - Develop trust-building strategies based on co-design and iteration PARTNERSHIP PREPAREDNESS \u00b6 In Commitment Pooling, institutional partnerships are vital \u2014 particularly between: - Humanitarian actors supporting communities - Core Service Providers (CSPs) maintaining technical/social infrastructure - Clearing Unions (CUs) offering legal and economic scaffolding All partnerships should be framed with signed service agreements , specifying: - Roles and responsibilities - Technical handover strategies - Financial obligations and fee ceilings - Dispute resolution mechanisms - Long-term sustainability and exit protocols Capacity Assessment for Core Service Providers \u00b6 Focus Area Key Criteria Services Can the CSP support digital accounts, identity recovery, dispute mediation, ledger integrity, and redemption tracking? Scalability Can the infrastructure scale to thousands of participants? Are microservices modular and reliable? Legal & Open Source Is the software governed by CopyLeft licenses (e.g. AGPL 3.0)? Are legal documents (CUA, CUMA) published and accessible? Inclusivity Is the system accessible to offline users, low-literacy participants, or those using basic feature phones? Fees & Equity Are services zero-rated or capped for vulnerable users? Is the CSP a nonprofit? Data & Security Is personal data encrypted and compliant with local/international laws? Are backups offline or community-hosted? TECHNOLOGICAL PREPAREDNESS \u00b6 Recommended Setup for Commitment Pool Infrastructure \u00b6 Open Source Software Ensure that the platform (wallets, ledgers, validation logic) is fully open-source and governed under non-restrictive licenses such as AGPL 3.0. Distributed Ledger Architecture Use systems that allow any trusted community member (or CSP) to run a node. Ledgers should be locally readable, auditable, and conservable without centralized servers. Interfaces / Wallet Access Wallets should allow users to assign guardians for password resets and support both digital and paper formats. Data Sharing Protocols Communities must consent to data collection. All shared data must be anonymous and used only for impact evidence and indexing. CSP Technological Assessment Checklist \u00b6 [ ] Digital accounts and ledger access provided via multiple interfaces (web, mobile, USSD, paper) [ ] Guardian mechanisms in place for lost access or dispute resolution [ ] Full support for seeding, swapping, redeeming, and tracking commitments [ ] Service scalability for new users across regions [ ] Open source licensing for all relevant software [ ] Offline and low-bandwidth access possible [ ] Secure backups of data and ledger states (local and distributed) [ ] Legal documents (CUA, CSP Agreement) signed and enforceable [ ] Documentation published in public repositories (e.g. GitHub) [ ] Long-term service sustainability plan in place (e.g. nonprofit-hosted CSP) Final Note \u00b6 Benefit and risk analysis for Commitment Pools is not only technical \u2014 it is relational. The greatest risk is loss of trust and memory . Therefore, social protocols, shared governance, and layered fallback systems must accompany technical deployments. The goal is not just resilience \u2014 it\u2019s regeneration . \ud83d\udd0d SITUATION ANALYSIS & STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT IN COMMITMENT POOLING \u00b6 \ud83c\udf3e Needs Assessment \u00b6 A needs assessment helps the Commitment Pool implementation team understand the ecological, relational, and material flows within a target community. It identifies: What goods, services, and care activities are most needed Who holds the capacity to fulfill these needs What gaps or barriers exist in access or trust How pooled commitments might bridge those gaps through coordinated fulfillment This lays the foundation for generating and routing vouchers (promises), and informs their volume, value, and stewardship structure. Objectives of Needs Assessment \u00b6 Understand basic material and social needs Identify key geographies and groups Define voucher flows based on community dynamics Inform valuation and redemption planning \ud83d\udd27 Assessment Process \u00b6 1. Design & Planning \u00b6 Define goals and outcomes of the assessment Identify stakeholders and community groups to engage Allocate time, facilitation, and trust-building resources 2. Data Collection \u00b6 Secondary Data Used to map historical vulnerabilities, past shocks, existing services, and economic activities. It also helps identify: - Recovery capacity - Program overlaps - Trust infrastructure (e.g. cooperatives, table banking, care circles) Primary Data Collected through: - Group dialogues - Household interviews - Trust mapping sessions - Focus groups on access barriers Topics include: - Goods/services most needed - Access constraints (cost, distance, trust, availability) - Trusted local suppliers - Preferred forms of contribution (labor, food, hours, repair) \ud83e\uddfa Minimum Trust Basket (MTB) \u00b6 Instead of a monetary \"expenditure basket,\" Commitment Pools begin with a Minimum Trust Basket \u2014a list of recurring goods and services valued by the community that might be exchanged through pooled commitments. Examples: - 1 bag of maize - 3 hours child care - 5 labor-hours of construction This basket helps define what vouchers to issue , by whom , and at what scale . \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f Resource & Trust Mapping \u00b6 Identify: - Local producers and services that can seed promises - Gaps in local fulfillment capacity - Supply chains or external supports needed - Redundancies or areas of uncoordinated care This mapping distinguishes between: - Supply-side issues : trust or production gaps - Demand-side issues : lack of redeemable commitments or accessible care Key considerations: - Can the local economy meet essential needs through pooled promises? - Are there already trusted informal networks in place? - Are redemption delays likely without capacity building? \u2705 Assessment Checklist for Voucher-Issuing Groups \u00b6 Question Why it matters Do they already trade among themselves in-kind or via trust? Shows readiness for non-monetary exchange Are they practicing group accounting (e.g. table banking)? Ensures memory and transparency Do they meet regularly and resolve disputes? Core to voucher redemption reliability Are their goods/services valuable to others? Ensures redemption feasibility Is there a redemption commitment agreement signed? Creates accountability Have they defined issuance limits (e.g. 10% of annual output)? Prevents overextension Does their pool levy (e.g. 2%) serve a community purpose? Reinforces feedback loops Have they signed membership in a Clearing Union? Legally anchors commitments \ud83c\udfaf Targeting for Pool Inclusion \u00b6 Because pools route promises rather than currency, targeting must focus on: - Groups with proven fulfillment capacity - Individuals with high-trust, low-liquidity needs - Geographic areas with sufficient production or care infrastructure \ud83e\uddea Example: Poor Targeting Risks \u00b6 If a group issues vouchers but lacks services or goods to redeem them, trust collapses. \"Promise washing\"\u2014where people circulate vouchers without fulfilling\u2014can destabilize the pool and reduce faith in the ecosystem. Prevention Strategy: - Use participatory diagnostics - Start small with redeemable commitments - Build capacity before enabling swaps or external trades \ud83e\udded Geographical Targeting \u00b6 Pools thrive where: - Markets or mutual aid networks exist - Goods/services can be accessed locally - Communities already practice reciprocity or table banking Mapping should account for: - Urban fluidity and cross-border activity - Shared marketplaces - Digital and physical access points (e.g. shops, water points) \ud83d\udc65 Beneficiary Targeting \u00b6 Ideal participants: - Are embedded in active community networks - Offer labor, care, or produce redeemable goods - Already operate with informal credit or trust practices Individual participants may also be invited if their offering (e.g. soap, eggs, tools, tutoring) aligns with the community's Minimum Trust Basket. \ud83e\ude9e Targeting Criteria \u00b6 Criteria Consideration Member of a community savings group Embedded in mutual trust Offers essential goods/services Redeemable promise flow Regularly participates in group meetings Accountability infrastructure Able to issue and redeem meaningfully Prevents empty circulation Participates in shared accounting Enables memory Signed agreements with Pool governance Anchors legal and social norms \ud83e\udd1d Transparency & Stakeholder Engagement \u00b6 Involve: - Local authorities - Peer humanitarian programs - Traders, elders, caregivers - Community stewards and youth Commitment Pooling is not extractive. It works best when participants feel seen, heard, and capable of fulfilling\u2014and when systems remain accountable to shared governance. \ud83e\udde9 Harmonizing with Other Programs \u00b6 Commitment Pooling can: - Complement CVA programs (e.g. layering care-based promises on top of cash support) - Reveal unmet needs through transaction patterns - Extend impact with minimal new funding In recovery settings, pooling enables community-defined priorities. In emergencies, vouchers may be fast-issued with temporary redemption anchors, and transitioned later into mutual pools. \ud83c\udf31 IMPLEMENTATION OF COMMITMENT POOLS \u00b6 \ud83e\udded Local Sensitization \u00b6 Trainers of Trainers (ToTs) \u00b6 Before engaging commitment-issuing groups or initiating community pooling, it's essential to train local ToTs \u2014individuals rooted in the community who understand local customs, networks, and languages. These ToTs help mediate trust, interpret value systems, and facilitate engagement with pool governance and promise logic. \ud83e\udec2 Sensitize Local Stakeholders \u00b6 Local leaders, cooperatives, faith groups, and small businesses should be sensitized to the core logic of Commitment Pooling : routing promises instead of money, fulfilling mutual obligations, and anchoring communal resilience. Use existing gatherings to introduce the idea that: \"This is not a new invention, but a remembered grammar of trust. We are reviving how communities have always pooled commitments to one another.\" Sensitization happens in two stages: 1. Community gatekeepers (chiefs, elders, traders) are engaged in closed sessions. 2. A wider community assembly is held to discuss pooling logic, trust flows, and participation conditions. Coordinate sensitization with existing stakeholders to avoid duplication and ensure optimal attendance. Align with local authorities to ensure legitimacy and smooth facilitation. \ud83e\uddfe Voucher Generation (Seeding Promises) \u00b6 Once commitment groups are identified and deemed pool-ready, each group undergoes a structured training on: Defining redeemable commitments Valuing promises (e.g., eggs, labor, tutoring hours) Tracking redemptions Setting issuance limits (max 12% of annual output) Ensuring every voucher seeded is backed by real capacity Voucher creation = seeding promises into a shared Commitment Pool . \u201cSeed only what you can fulfill. Pooling is metabolic: overpromising chokes the system.\u201d Each voucher issued represents a share of future production or service. These vouchers: - May be swapped within the pool - Are redeemable directly from the issuer - Can be routed toward social support (e.g. elderly care) \ud83d\udcce See: voucher creation steps \ud83e\udd1d Conflict Resolution \u00b6 Establish community-rooted mediation structures to resolve: - Disputes around valuation - Redemption refusals - Exit disagreements Use existing customary structures (councils, women's groups, etc.) to root the trust tribunal logic. All pool members should understand and agree to this restorative process before any vouchers are seeded. \ud83d\udce3 Community Mobilization \u00b6 After vouchers are issued, community mobilization ensures: - Trust-based uptake of vouchers - Responsible circulation - Awareness of redemption terms \u26a0\ufe0f Warning : Issued vouchers must not be airdropped freely outside the redemption group without consent. Doing so overextends promise capacity. Each group should invite 3\u20135 trusted peers to begin accepting the voucher as payment, ensuring: - Redemption is possible (goods/services exist) - Trust is mutual - Capacity is documented If a group donates vouchers (e.g. to elders), it becomes a social enterprise \u2014a valuable story to uplift. \ud83d\udd01 Using Vouchers: Circulation & Demurrage \u00b6 Once seeded, vouchers circulate: - Within issuing groups - To trusted partners - In swaps with other community promises To encourage flow and prevent hoarding, a demurrage mechanism (e.g., 1% monthly decay) can be introduced. This aligns with natural cycles: trust must move to stay alive . Educate all members on: - Swap protocols - Demurrage rules - Redemption commitments \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f Capacity Development & Integrated Support \u00b6 Humanitarian partners can: 1. Build Capacity : Train groups to increase redeemable production\u2014e.g., maize mills, poultry co-ops, child care collectives. 2. Support via Commitments : - Purchase local vouchers (pre-buying services) - Redistribute them in lieu of CVA (cash) programs - Keep value circulating inside the ecosystem 3. Index Trust Flows : - Map voucher circulation to SDGs - Certify impact for donors 4. Create Treasuries : - Hold committed value to redistribute during shocks This avoids extractive aid models and boosts local self-determination. \ud83e\uddcd Participant Registration \u00b6 New entrants\u2014vendors, caregivers, laborers\u2014may be registered by: - Issuing groups (peer invitation) - Field staff (during cycles of program expansion) Minimum data: - Demographic info - Contact & location - Socioeconomic metrics (e.g. PPI ) All registration must: - Be ethical - Align with data privacy standards - Enable follow-up for redemption audits and trust certification \ud83e\uddfe Verification & Databases \u00b6 To prevent duplication: - Use unique IDs (e.g. phone or ID numbers) - Store in open or consortium-managed ledgers - Regularly audit for redemption and seeding balance A Core Service Provider (CSP) manages the ledger (digital or paper-based). The CSP ensures continuity, visibility, and technical integrity. \ud83d\udeaa Exit Strategy \u00b6 \ud83c\udf93 Ongoing Education \u00b6 Train local champions in: - Pool logic - Voucher lifecycle - Conflict mediation - Seeding and redemption audits Use community-generated media (e.g. theatre, murals, song) to encode protocol memory. \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Infrastructure Sustainability \u00b6 Partner with non-profit CSPs committed to open source tools Ensure local ownership of ledgers (distributed if possible) Provide fallback protocols (e.g. offline paper redemption) in case of tech outages \ud83d\udd17 Stakeholder Weaving \u00b6 \" Braid \" IGAs (Income Generating Activities) together by: - Facilitating regular barter/swap sessions - Sharing trust metrics across groups - Encouraging interdependence, not competition This transforms discrete groups into a networked metabolism . A successful Commitment Pool project doesn\u2019t end when the team exits\u2014it evolves as a trust commons , stewarded by its participants. \ud83d\udcca MONITORING & EVALUATION OF COMMITMENT POOLS \u00b6 Monitoring a commitment pool is a continuous, reflexive process that helps communities and stewards understand how promises are flowing, where trust is thriving, and where adjustments are needed to improve fulfillment and ecosystem balance. \ud83d\udd0d Process, Output, and Outcome Monitoring \u00b6 \ud83d\udcb1 Trust Flow Monitoring (Voucher Use) \u00b6 Core questions to assess the health of the pool: Velocity of Promises : Are vouchers changing hands frequently? High velocity signals vibrant trust circulation and local production alignment. Transaction Spread : Is voucher use evenly distributed? Or are only a few members trading? Low spread may signal barriers to access or trust. Demographic Inclusion : Who is transacting? Disaggregate by gender, age, role to surface inclusion gaps. Use this to inform targeted outreach. Commodity Anchoring : What types of goods or services are being exchanged? Are vouchers routing toward local production or external dependencies? Trust flows must reflect community metabolism\u2014not just economic activity. \ud83d\uded2 Market Monitoring \u00b6 To ensure the pool doesn\u2019t distort or destabilize community trade: Price Watch : Monitor key goods to track if voucher-based trade causes local inflation. Availability Audits : Are key goods consistently available? Does redemption capacity stay in sync with voucher issuance? Supply vs. Demand Mapping : Ensure local traders can restock and liquidity isn\u2019t overly dependent on vouchers. Commitment pooling is intended to stabilize and support trade\u2014not distort it. \ud83d\udcd3 Spending Journals \u00b6 Track both: - Voucher-based spending - National currency spending Journals help identify: - Whether vouchers retain value locally while cash leaks out - Seasonal or shock-based shifts in economic behavior - Complementarity of pooled commitments with other forms of aid \ud83d\udcde Baseline, Inline, and Endline Reflections \u00b6 Use surveys, phone interviews, and testimonials to surface: Shifts in trust relationships Changes in perceived community resilience Levels of participation in cooperative exchange \ud83d\udcf9 Testimonial videos are powerful in rural settings. Let pool members speak to each other across regions\u2014regeneration is contagious. \ud83e\udde0 Evaluation \u00b6 Plan an evaluation aligned with wider strategic and policy questions. Good evaluation asks: Are pools increasing incomes and fulfillment capacity? Are they reducing debt and dependency? Is community trade diversifying? Are trust flows equitable? Where possible: - Use external evaluators - Set clear terms of reference - Include regenerative indicators (e.g. local production, mutual aid frequency, fulfillment rates) \ud83d\udd04 Sharing M&E Learnings \u00b6 Insights from monitoring and evaluation should be shared: Internally : With pool stewards and facilitators for learning loops Externally : With local authorities, peer organizations, and donors to support: Coordination Transparency Avoidance of duplicative or extractive interventions Monitoring trust flows is not surveillance\u2014it\u2019s stewardship. \ud83d\udcda APPENDICES & RESOURCES \u00b6 \ud83c\udf31 Educational \u00b6 Glossary FAQ Community Training Guide Voucher Creation Summary Case Study Book Quiz \u2699\ufe0f Operations \u00b6 Logical Framework Team Training Guide Stakeholder Engagement Guide Humanitarian Support \ud83d\udcc1 docs.grassecon.org/ops \u2696\ufe0f Legal \u00b6 Economic Commons Licence Clearing Union Agreement Voucher Creation Protocol Service Agreement Data Policy \ud83d\udcc1 docs.grassecon.org/commons \ud83d\udda5\ufe0f Software \u00b6 Core Services + Ledger Wallet Interfaces Developer Tools \ud83d\udcc1 software.grassecon.org \ud83d\udce6 External Tools \u00b6 Cash Hub for CVA Voucher Quick Guide (CaLP 2011)","title":"Program Toolkit"},{"location":"ops/pqt/#programme-quality-toolkit","text":"For implementing Commitment Pool Protocols Disclaimer This PQT is made possible by the generous support of Danish Red Cross, Norwegian Red Cross, and Kenya Red Cross Society.

Learning through Games : Demonstrations using the bean game in our Community Training Guide help simulate a pool. The thread game visualizes the network of trust and commitment. Registration : Members join the Grassroots Economic Commons and register at sarafu.network . They receive training on account setup, using digital vouchers, password recovery, and mutual redemption. Voucher Declaration : Using the Sarafu Network , groups create a sample commitment. This includes the type of promise, quantity, and redemption agreement. Member Commitments : Members decide what each one can commit to redeem for others' vouchers. These are registered into the pool as promises. Final Demo Game : Re-play the bean game to reinforce understanding of redemption, expiration, and trust flows. Leaving Forms : Voucher declaration forms are left with the group to complete collectively. Support Creation and Audit \u00b6 Follow-ups : To assist with any onboarding issues or clarification. Audits and Conflict Mitigation : Internal and external audits help ensure that all commitments can reasonably be fulfilled. Mediators help resolve non-redemption or disputes. Agreements Signed : Economic Commons Agreement : Terms of participation in the broader ecosystem. Voucher Declaration / Membership Agreement : Defines the unit of account, redemption commitments, pool limits, expiration, mediation and internal fund rules. Service Agreement : With a Core Service Provider like Grassroots Economics for platform access, training, and arbitration. Minting / Voucher Creation : Once commitments are verified, a smart contract is created on-chain, tracking all promises, fulfillment, expiration, and circulation rules. Initial Voucher Distribution : Vouchers are distributed as per the agreed plan. A treasurer may manage a group reserve. Expired vouchers flow into a community fund to support shared projects or vulnerable members. Review and Launch Preparation \u00b6 Review : Reinforce understanding of how Commitment Pooling works. Chama Book : The issuing group should regularly track balances and fulfillment. Marketing Materials : Placards and signs help participants communicate that they accept specific CAVs. Social Fabric Map : Visually track connections between members. Launch Prep : Plan event logistics, engage elders and leaders, promote acceptance beyond the issuing group, and onboard others through sarafu.network. Launching and Continued Support \u00b6 Greater Community Outreach : Issuers can grow the pool by helping others trust and accept CAVs. This \u201cbraiding\u201d expands the network of care. Long-Term Maintenance : Imbalances may occur. Regular market days and community meetings can clear debt and reconnect trust. Use expiration (demurrage) to encourage circulation and prevent hoarding.
