# Voucher (CAV) Creation

This is a summary of a group Voucher creation process using **Commitment Pooling**. A group of service providers (e.g., tomato sellers, school teachers, hairdressers) come together to create a commons centered around their contributions. Please see the [glossary](/edu/glossary/) of terms and visit [sarafu.network](https://sarafu.network) for more.

## Awareness
1. **Workshops**: Meetings with regional and local stakeholders to explain the Commitment Pooling concept and answer all questions. These workshops should be done yearly and when stakeholders change (e.g., new administration or area chief).

## Training
1. **Intro**: Group introductions, setting of intentions (prayers), historical overview and introduction to Commitment Pooling and CAVs.
2. **Resource Mapping**: Communities map out resources and needs. The training guide helps reveal what each member can offer and what they can redeem.
3. **Learning through Games**: Demonstrations using the bean game in our [Community Training Guide](/edu/training/) help simulate a pool. The thread game visualizes the network of trust and commitment.
4. **Registration**: Members join the Grassroots Economic Commons and register at [sarafu.network](https://sarafu.network). They receive training on account setup, using digital vouchers, password recovery, and mutual redemption.
5. **Voucher Declaration**: Using the [Sarafu Network](https://sarafu.network/vouchers/create), groups create a sample commitment. This includes the type of promise, quantity, and redemption agreement.
6. **Member Commitments**: Members decide what each one can commit to redeem for others' vouchers. These are registered into the pool as promises.
7. **Final Demo Game**: Re-play the bean game to reinforce understanding of redemption, expiration, and trust flows.
8. **Leaving Forms**: Voucher declaration forms are left with the group to complete collectively.

## Support Creation and Audit
1. **Follow-ups**: To assist with any onboarding issues or clarification.
2. **Audits and Conflict Mitigation**: Internal and external audits help ensure that all commitments can reasonably be fulfilled. Mediators help resolve non-redemption or disputes.
3. **Agreements Signed**:
   - **Economic Commons Agreement**: Terms of participation in the broader ecosystem.
   - **Voucher Declaration / Membership Agreement**: Defines the unit of account, redemption commitments, pool limits, expiration, mediation and internal fund rules.
   - **Service Agreement**: With a Core Service Provider like Grassroots Economics for platform access, training, and arbitration.

4. **Minting / Voucher Creation**: Once commitments are verified, a smart contract is created on-chain, tracking all promises, fulfillment, expiration, and circulation rules.
5. **Initial Voucher Distribution**: Vouchers are distributed as per the agreed plan. A treasurer may manage a group reserve. Expired vouchers flow into a community fund to support shared projects or vulnerable members.

## Review and Launch Preparation
1. **Review**: Reinforce understanding of how Commitment Pooling works.
2. **Chama Book**: The issuing group should regularly track balances and fulfillment.
3. **Marketing Materials**: Placards and signs help participants communicate that they accept specific CAVs.
4. **Social Fabric Map**: Visually track connections between members.
5. **Launch Prep**: Plan event logistics, engage elders and leaders, promote acceptance beyond the issuing group, and onboard others through sarafu.network.

## Launching and Continued Support
1. **Greater Community Outreach**: Issuers can grow the pool by helping others trust and accept CAVs. This “braiding” expands the network of care.
2. **Long-Term Maintenance**: Imbalances may occur. Regular market days and community meetings can clear debt and reconnect trust. Use expiration (demurrage) to encourage circulation and prevent hoarding.

> A healthy Commitment Pool flows like a river of care—not stored as stagnant capital.
