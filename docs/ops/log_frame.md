# ðŸ§­ Logical Framework for Commitment Pool Implementation

| **Stage & Goal** | **Output** | **Activities** | **Output Indicators** |
|------------------|------------|----------------|------------------------|
| **1.1 Implementer Prepared** | Core teams understand commitment pooling and are ready to support networks | Conduct feasibility study, stakeholder role alignment, and ecosystem mapping | Reports on feasibility, partner roles, and potential pools |
|  |  | Risk & trust dynamics assessment | Trust/Risk matrix & validation summary |
|  |  | Map local and external support partners (e.g. VSLA, NGOs) | Inventory of aligned programs |
| **1.2 Infrastructure Ready** | Distributed ledger, pool registry, and support systems in place | Identify Core Service Providers (CSPs) for pool governance | Signed MoUs for support & training |
|  |  | Deploy node for ledger access; distribute local backups | Node list and community access logs |
|  |  | Create user dashboards and localized interfaces | Working dashboard, multilingual usability tests |
|  |  | Provide wallet tools (USSD, Web, Paper) | Use case demonstrations & feedback |
| **2.1 Stakeholder Engagement** | Community and institutional allies aligned | Identify trusted elders, cooperatives, women/youth groups | Stakeholder map |
|  |  | Intro meetings with local authorities | Letters of support |
|  |  | Present pooling logic and commitments protocol | Engagement summary |
| **2.2 Regional Ownership** | Implementation co-designed with communities | Community validation workshops | Participation roster and feedback |
|  |  | Define voucher types, limits, and roles with groups | Drafted and signed Pool Agreements |
|  |  | Screening for trustworthy redeemable offerings | Completed screening tool |
| **2.3 Measure Capacity** | Baseline trust & capacity measured | Baseline survey (capacity & commitments) | Survey report |
|  |  | Track current exchanges (currency & in-kind) | Spending journals distributed |
|  |  | Stakeholder feedback loop on baseline | Shared baseline report |
| **2.4 Tech & Materials Localized** | Interfaces and tools adapted to context | Customize training and pool rules | Implementation-ready guide |
|  |  | Test tech access (USSD/web/paper) | Tech validation report |
| **3.1 Group Formed and Issue Vouchers** | First commitment pool seeded | Train community facilitators | Training roster |
|  |  | Facilitate group mapping of commitments | Fulfillment matrix |
|  |  | Sign Pool and Economic Commons agreements | Agreements archived |
|  |  | Issue type-keyed vouchers based on verified promises | Ledger records and balances |
| **3.2a Community Trust Extended** | Broad trust ecosystem around pool | Train mobilizers and explain trust protocols | Mobilizer logs |
|  |  | Group members introduce 5+ new participants each | Active user list |
|  |  | Deploy local outreach (SMS, posters, storytelling) | Engagement proof |
| **3.2b Increase Redeemability** | Group capacity increases through investment | Identify IGA/trust-supporting services | Project proposal |
|  |  | Training and tools for new capacity | Procurement + skill logs |
|  |  | Adjust pool issuance with verified capacity | Pool issuance amendments |
|  |  | Expand pool access to vulnerable users via voucher purchases | Distribution logs |
| **4.1 Impact Evaluation** | Systematic monitoring of trust flows | Monitor swap/redeem/fulfill rates on ledger | Ongoing reports |
|  |  | Monthly and endline surveys | Surveys + spending log comparison |
|  |  | Synthesize impact across social & economic trust | Final evaluation report |
|  |  | Share best practices | Lessons learned document |

> This framework supports regenerative trust economies where promisesâ€”not productsâ€”are the unit of care.
