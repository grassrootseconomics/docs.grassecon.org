# Stakeholder Engagement Guide

*For the Implementation of Commitment Pooling in New Communities*

---

## üå± Introduction

Commitment Pooling offers communities a metabolic system of trust, where promises‚Äînot money‚Äîform the fabric of economic coordination. Unlike extractive models of aid, it relies on community-owned records of contributions, redemptions, and mutual care. In implementing Commitment Pools, it is essential to engage stakeholders continuously‚Äînot just at inception, but throughout the evolution of the pool.

This guide outlines best practices for implementers to build long-term, trust-based relationships with community members and local institutions. Stakeholder engagement is not a box-ticking exercise; it is how pools grow, are protected, and are eventually owned by the communities themselves.

## üß© Key Points in Stakeholder Engagement

### ü§ù Build Rapport Early

Relationship building takes time. Begin with informal visits alongside local leaders. Be clear this is about community autonomy and shared trust‚Äînot charity or external control.

> Early engagement allows for co-design and preempts misunderstandings. Trust grows before a pool is seeded.

### üéØ Begin With the End in Mind

The goal of Commitment Pooling is community autonomy. Design your engagement with an exit strategy. Ensure community members are supported to run, govern, and sustain pools themselves‚Äîwithout dependency on the implementing organization.

### üõ† Community-Owned Programming

Every community has a living history of reciprocity: labor sharing, social funds, care networks. Pools should amplify, not overwrite, these. Embed local elders, cooperatives, and care groups in every step‚Äîfrom voucher design to governance and redemption protocols.

## üìå Part One: Principles of Stakeholder Engagement

### Who Are Stakeholders?

In a Commitment Pooling context, stakeholders include:

- Local community members and their associations
- Women and youth groups
- Elders, teachers, caregivers
- Local religious and cultural leaders
- Government officials
- Civil society and cooperatives
- Vulnerable households and marginalized groups

### Eight Core Engagement Functions

1. **Stakeholder Identification & Trust Mapping**  
   Identify trust anchors‚Äîthose whose word holds weight. Map relationships that already route care.

2. **Accessible Information Sharing**  
   Use local language and metaphors: "Your promise is enough", "trust flows", "memory of contribution". Explain pools as shared ledgers of care.

3. **Reciprocal Consultation**  
   Let design emerge from community logic. What promises feel trustworthy? What commitments are redeemable?

4. **Trust-Based Negotiation**  
   Align pool parameters (credit limits, time bounds, fees) through inclusive discussion. Use story circles or village forums.

5. **Open Grievance Pathways**  
   Use local conflict mediators. Empower elders and mutual aid groups to guide redemption conflicts or delayed fulfillment.

6. **Participatory Monitoring**  
   Let users review pool flows regularly. Who is fulfilling? What trust patterns are emerging? Feedback loops keep pools living.

7. **Transparent Reporting**  
   Regularly share snapshots of the pool: fulfilled commitments, trust balances, emergent needs.

8. **Ongoing Relationship Stewardship**  
   Ensure implementing agents are accountable to the community. Train local stewards and recorders.

## üìò Part Two: Phases and Practices

### üìê Design Phase

- Co-design voucher types and fulfillment protocols with local groups
- Identify vulnerable households and their care needs
- Use storytelling and games to explain commitment pooling

### üîé Feasibility & Trust Readiness

- Assess trust dynamics and redemption capacity
- Document local networks of reciprocity
- Pilot trust circles with small swaps and redemptions

### üîÑ Operationalization

- Support creation of Pool Agreements and limits
- Train stewards in memory recording (digital or paper)
- Align pool data with local seasonal cycles and labor patterns

### üõ° Sustainability

- Transition to community governance
- Develop local fallback protocols for unresolved redemptions
- Create shared social funds for emergency trust repair

**Subject: Engagement on Commitment Pooling with Local Communities**

Dear [Title/Name],

With the support of community groups, elders, and local organizations, we are assisting in the establishment of **Commitment Pools**‚Äîshared registries of promises that support mutual care and local livelihoods.

Commitment Pools are **not about money**, but about **tracking who contributes, fulfills, and receives**. They strengthen existing forms of trust‚Äîsuch as labor sharing, community lending, or informal barter.

We request your permission to introduce this community-led coordination tool. Our goal is not to lead, but to support communities to self-organize using a trust-based model.

We look forward to your guidance and support.

Warm regards,
