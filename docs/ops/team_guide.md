# Commitment Pool Implementation Team Guide

Implementation team development is a collaborative effort between supervisors and team members (staff or volunteers) to align personal intentions with the shared mission of Commitment Pooling in communities. Development efforts are focused on deepening each team member’s capacity to support relational economies. Episodic and spontaneous volunteers also receive regular feedback and mutual support.

You are a great fit for a Commitment Pool implementation team if:

1. You care deeply about the long-term well-being of your community.
2. You are self-driven and able to work autonomously.
3. You are adaptable and can improvise under changing conditions.
4. You are skilled at building trust and communicating across generations.
5. You are aware of financial and trust-based coordination challenges in your area.
6. You understand how value circulates in local economies.
7. You have basic skills in setting up and sustaining community enterprises.
8. You are curious about post-currency economies and mutual aid.

## Team Member Training

All team members should have equal access to orientation and learning resources. Team member development is a collaboration between Grassroots Economics, Red Cross, and other implementing partners. The training integrates digital tools like [sarafu.network](https://sarafu.network) with analog practices like mutual aid, seed sharing, and community audits.

## Communicating with Supervisors

Each department supervisor maintains regular communications with their team members and ensures proper documentation is submitted to the Operations Manager. Any major changes in a team member’s role or availability should be reported. Team members should have clear contact channels to their supervisor for concerns or coordination.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

For orientation to Commitment Pooling concepts, visit the FAQ [here](https://docs.grassecon.org/faq/).

## Reimbursement for Approved Expenses

Team members may receive reimbursement for pre-approved project-related costs. Use of personal vehicles may be reimbursed by mileage. All expenses should be logged clearly, including receipts for parking, tolls, or materials.

## Attendance

Team members are expected to uphold consistency and punctuality. Notify your supervisor at least two hours in advance if you are late or unavailable. Chronic absences may result in reevaluation of your involvement.

## Workplace Safety and Security

Safe and supportive working environments are a collective responsibility. Team members should report any unsafe conditions or threats—physical or digital—without fear of retaliation. Internal safety updates and training sessions (e.g. PSEA, cybersecurity) should be attended regularly.

## PSEA Sensitivity and Training

All team members are required to complete the UNICEF [PSEA module](https://agora.unicef.org/course/info.php?id=7380). Respect, boundary awareness, and harm prevention are foundational to all Commitment Pooling work.

## Nepotism and Fraternization

Close relations working in the same unit must disclose their relationship to avoid perceived favoritism or conflict. The agency may reassign one party to a different team if necessary.

## Confidential Information and Intellectual Property

All tools, materials, and protocols developed through implementation belong to the ecosystem. Team members must sign a Confidentiality and IP Agreement to protect shared knowledge and safeguard sensitive contributions.

## Data Protection and Privacy

Handling community data is a sacred trust. Respect local confidentiality customs and comply with international [data policy standards](https://docs.grassecon.org/data_policy/). Always ask consent before recording, storing, or publishing.
