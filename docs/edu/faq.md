## ðŸ”° Basics

### What is a Voucher?
A voucher is a **promise** of future contributionâ€”such as labor, goods, services, or careâ€”that can be **redeemed** by others within a community. Vouchers are not currencies or assets. They are **commitments**, issued and fulfilled in trust-based systems.

### What is Commitment Pooling?
Commitment pooling is a coordination protocol where communities **track, exchange, and fulfill promises** using shared memory rather than centralized authority or currency. The pool acts as a living record of who has offered what and helps route care, labor, and trust.

It is not invented. It is rememberedâ€”mirroring traditional practices like seed sharing, labor exchange, and informal credit networks.

### How do I create a Voucher?
Any individual or group can issue a voucher by making a **clear commitment**â€”for example, "I will provide 1 dozen eggs" or "3 hours of carpentry." These are recorded in your **Own Held** and can be seeded into a **Commitment Pool** for others to withdraw and redeem.

### How is the value of a Voucher determined?
The value of a voucher is set by its issuerâ€”usually in simple units (e.g., 1 egg, 1 hour). There is no fixed exchange rate between vouchers or national currency. Value emerges through **reciprocity and shared trust**.

### How do I get more Vouchers?
- **By fulfilling commitments** and being trusted in return
- **By issuing your own voucher** with a clear promise
- **By exchanging with others** via a Commitment Pool (Swap)

### What is a Commitment Pool?
A shared registry of **unclaimed, active commitments**â€”available for community members to withdraw. Pools are type-and-issuer-keyed, and only commitments that have been explicitly seeded are available for use.

## ðŸ›  Running a Trust-Based Economy

### What happens when I seed a Voucher?
Seeding places your promise into the shared pool:
- Your **Debt** increases
- Your **Own Held** decreases
- The pool gains a new usable commitment

### What does it mean to swap Vouchers?
Swapping means offering your own promise in exchange for someone elseâ€™s from the pool. It allows coordination without centralized control.

### What does it mean to redeem a Voucher?
Redemption is the fulfillment of a commitment. The voucher returns to the issuer, who provides the agreed good or service. It is **not repayment**â€”it is **care made real**.

### What is Trade Balance?
Trade Balance reflects how much youâ€™ve contributed vs. received:
- A **positive balance** means youâ€™ve given more than youâ€™ve received
- A **negative balance** means youâ€™ve received more and should fulfill or seed back

### What if I canâ€™t fulfill my promise?
Redemption relies on trust. If you are delayed or unable to fulfill, communicate openly. Redemption delays can erode trust, and may require community mediation.

## ðŸŒ± Starting and Sustaining a Pool

### Do I need permission to start a pool?
No. All you need is:
- A clear promise
- A witness or community member to engage with
- A shared space (digital or physical) to track memory

### How do I invite others?
Use **trust first**. Invite those who are already coordinating informallyâ€”farmers, care workers, teachers, fixers. Share the story and start small.

### What tools can I use?
- **USSD for feature phones**
- **React-based Web Interface at [sarafu.network](https://sarafu.network)**
- **Paper vouchers** for offline exchange
- **Community-led ledgers** (e.g., notebooks, boards, or airtime logs)

### What if others wonâ€™t accept my voucher?
- Ask what they need to feel trust
- Offer to fulfill someone elseâ€™s voucher first
- Build small clusters of reciprocal trust

## ðŸ¤² Group Use & Governance

### Can a group issue a Voucher?
Yes. Community groups (chamas, co-ops, care circles) can issue shared commitments and distribute them as member credit or emergency support.

### What if someone abuses the pool?
Every action is tracked. Pools can self-govern using shared agreements and redemption memory. Issuers who donâ€™t fulfill lose credibility and access.

### Do Vouchers expire?
They may include **time expectations**, but donâ€™t disappear. Expiry may be handled by trust dynamics or consensus.

### Is the technology open source?
Yes. Documentation and code are maintained at [github.com/grassrootseconomics](https://github.com/grassrootseconomics).

## ðŸ’¡ Philosophy

### Why use commitment pooling instead of currency?
Because care is not transactional. In many communities, scarcity is not of moneyâ€”but of coordination. Pooling honors relationships, avoids debt traps, and strengthens local resilience.

### What are the benefits of pooling?
- Track who owes whatâ€”not in money, but in service
- Strengthen community memory and mutual aid
- Seed trust where extraction once ruled
- Restore agency to people and groups to self-coordinate

### What if I just want to help?
- Join a pool and fulfill a commitment
- Redeem someone elseâ€™s promise
- Help document and witness trust in action
- Support tech stewards and local recorders

## ðŸŽ¯ Final Note

Commitment pooling is a **living system of care**. Every voucher is a story. Every redemption is a promise kept. 

> Your promise is enough. Let the pools beginâ€”wherever you are.
