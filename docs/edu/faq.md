## 🔰 Basics

### What is a Voucher?
A voucher is a **promise of future contribution**—such as labor, goods, or services—that can be **redeemed** by someone else. It is not a product, asset, or money. A voucher is a **traceable commitment**, issued with trust and fulfilled with care.

### What is Commitment Pooling?
Commitment pooling is a protocol for **coordinated cooperation**. It lets people and groups seed their promises into a shared pool, track who has fulfilled what, and swap commitments to meet local needs.

It is **not invented—it is remembered**. It echoes seed exchanges, care webs, and mutual aid traditions found across cultures.

### How do I create a Voucher?
You issue a voucher when you make a clear, witnessed promise—for example:
- “I will provide 10kg of maize”
- “I offer 5 hours of tutoring”

That voucher starts in your **Own Held**, and you can then **seed** it into a shared pool for others to access.

### How is the value of a Voucher determined?
By the issuer. Most use simple parity measures (e.g., 1 voucher = 1 unit of service or goods). Value arises from **trusted redeemability**, not external pricing.

### How do I get more Vouchers?
You can:
- **Fulfill a voucher** from someone else (builds trust)
- **Issue your own**, backed by capacity you control
- **Swap** your voucher for another through the pool

### What is a Commitment Pool?
It’s a shared, type-keyed registry of **unfulfilled commitments**. The pool is where trust is stored, tracked, and routed. Only seeded promises appear here—others must be offered directly or fulfilled privately.

## 🛠 Practicing Pool Logic

### What happens when I seed a Voucher?
- Your **Debt** increases
- Your **Own Held** decreases
- The Pool gains access to your promise
This signals to others: “I stand ready to fulfill this.”

### What does it mean to swap Vouchers?
You exchange your Own Held voucher (your promise) for someone else’s from the pool. It’s not barter—it's **routing unmet needs to willing contributors**.

### What does it mean to redeem a Voucher?
Redemption happens when someone **calls in a promise**. You fulfill the good or service. The voucher returns to you, and you can reuse or re-seed it.

> Redemption is not repayment. It is trust, fulfilled.

### What is Trade Balance?
Trade balance = promises kept vs. promises received.
- Positive = you’ve given more than you’ve received
- Negative = you owe service/care back into the pool

### What if I can’t fulfill my promise?
Communicate early. Pools work on trust. Unfulfilled redemptions can hurt the whole group. Mediation, fallback agreements, or swap reversals may be used.

## 🌱 Starting a Commitment Pool

### Do I need permission to start?
No. Commitment Pooling is a permissionless trust logic.

To begin:
1. Make a promise
2. Record it
3. Share it with others

A promise and a witness are enough.

### How do I invite others?
- Start with people who already exchange informally
- Use memory, not marketing
- Ask: “What can we promise one another?”

### What tools can I use?
- **USSD or SMS** (for basic phones)
- **[Sarafu.Network](https://sarafu.network)** (web interface)
- **Paper ledgers or slips** (for offline pools)
- **Community boards or airtime logs** (local record-keeping)

### What if others won’t accept my voucher?
Trust needs to grow:
- Seed first
- Redeem someone else’s voucher to show reciprocity
- Document fulfilled promises

## 🤲 Group Agreements

### Can groups issue Vouchers?
Yes. Groups can:
- Make collective promises (e.g., “We will host a weekly clinic”)
- Pool member contributions
- Use seeded vouchers to support shared projects or care roles

### What happens if someone misuses the pool?
Memory protects the pool. Every action is recorded. If someone repeatedly fails to redeem their promises, others can:
- Pause swaps with them
- Redeem only with trusted issuers
- Use group governance or fallback protocols

### Do Vouchers expire?
Vouchers may include **expiration windows** to prevent hoarding. For example:
- 2% monthly demurrage (encourages use)
- Return to group fund if idle for too long

Expiry terms are agreed at pool setup.

### Is the technology open source?
Yes. You can fork or contribute at:
[github.com/grassrootseconomics](https://github.com/grassrootseconomics)

## 💡 Philosophy

### Why use a pool instead of currency?
Because coordination is often more scarce than money. Pools:
- Honor local labor and care
- Avoid market extraction
- Amplify mutuality and visibility
- Give people tools to **trust at scale**

### What are the benefits of Commitment Pooling?
- **Trust routing** instead of price discovery
- A **shared metabolic memory** of what’s been offered, fulfilled, and needed
- Strengthened agency without waiting for outside approval

### What if I just want to help?
- Join a pool and seed a small promise
- Fulfill someone else’s commitment
- Support those recording pool memory (tech stewards, scribes, elders)
- Tell your story—memory multiplies trust

## 🎯 Final Word

Commitment pooling is not a system to be sold—it is a field of care to be remembered.

> When we track promises together, we restore dignity to coordination.

Let the pools begin.
