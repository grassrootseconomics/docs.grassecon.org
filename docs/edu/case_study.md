# Case Study: Commitment Pooling in Binguni and Mbele, Kenya

## 🌍 Trapped Abundance

In a rural Kenyan region, 400 households struggle with **chronic money scarcity**, but **abundant latent capacity**: time, skills, natural resources, and local needs. Humanitarian support and remittances provide temporary relief, but don’t unlock **endogenous development**.

> “There is land to farm and people to farm it — but no way to coordinate those capacities.”

The community's greatest need is food sovereignty. They have land, seeds, and labor, but they **lack a metabolic trust system** to route commitments. They are stuck in a cycle of subsistence.

Within this region, one self-organized group—**Binguni**—operates as a savings collective (a chama/VSLA), supporting members through pooled funds. But with limited liquidity, their dreams of community farming remain unfulfilled.

## 🧭 Enter: Commitment Pooling

A **Core Service Provider (CSP)** introduces Binguni to **Commitment Pooling**, a regenerative coordination protocol enabling them to recognize and activate trust among themselves.

Through workshops, the group learns that:

- Commitments are not assets—they are **promises of future contributions**.
- Vouchers can represent those promises, traceable and redeemable.
- A **Commitment Pool** allows members to **seed** their promises and withdraw others’, creating a metabolic flow of goods, services, and labor.

The CSP helps Binguni **map their collective capacity**, and the group discovers over **50,000 KES** worth of monthly redeemable value—from seeds and water to cooking and labor.

They decide to co-issue a **Community Asset Voucher (CAV)** named **BIGI**, backed by this internal value.

## 🤝 Forming a Trust Protocol

To activate their CAV system, the Binguni group formalizes three agreements:

1. **Economic Commons Agreement** — Members agree to enter a shared ecosystem based on trust, fulfillment, and community rules.
2. **Membership Agreement** — They:
   - Quantify and audit individual commitments (e.g. James commits 10kg seeds worth 2500 KES).
   - Set group issuance limits (max 50,000 BIGIs).
   - Agree on internal credit limits and a demurrage system (e.g., 2% monthly decay to encourage flow).
   - Create a **shared reserve** by pooling part of their vouchers (e.g., 200 BIGIs each).
3. **CU Intermember Agreement** — Defines roles of the CSP (ledger access, arbitration, training).

This trust fabric enables Binguni to **mint 50,000 BIGIs**, with 2,300 going to each member and 4,000 held in the communal pool for a shared farm project.

## 🔁 Circulation: Commitments Come Alive

Commitment Pooling begins:

- **James** gives **20 BIGIs** to **Pamela** for cakes.
- Pamela pays **Joyce** 200 BIGIs for help cooking.
- Joyce spends 300 BIGIs on water from **John**.

Midday snapshot:

| Member  | BIGI Balance |
|---------|--------------|
| Pamela  | 2120         |
| Joyce   | 2200         |
| John    | 2600         |

At a community market, Pamela sells potatoes:
- 50 sold in BIGIs to Binguni members = 250 BIGIs
- 50 sold in shillings = 250 KES

Her balance rises to 2370 BIGIs + 250 KES. This dual liquidity model boosts both **savings** and **circulation**.

## 🌾 Project Activation

Binguni uses their pooled reserve to jumpstart a **community farm**, but lack enough labor. They approach a neighboring group—**Mbele**, whose women farmers agree to accept **BIGIs** as partial payment.

Trust has now **crossed group boundaries**, routed through redeemed commitments.

Inspired, Mbele decides to form their own Commitment Pool and issue **MBELE** vouchers, backed by their services (e.g., erosion control, water management).

Binguni and Mbele **cross-accept** each other’s vouchers. Their pools are distinct, but interoperable—forming a **meshed commons**.

> “BIGIs and MBELEs start to flow between the groups, stitching capacity into coordination.”

---

## 🌱 Coordination and Learning

Both groups invest part of their reserve vouchers into **group businesses**—like a maize mill and agroforestry training. The CSP provides skill-building and protocol stewardship, ensuring that:

- Trust flows are conserved
- Commitments are fulfilled
- Exchange remains relational, not extractive

**John**, the plow-owner, begins accepting both BIGIs and MBELEs, confident in their redeemability.

The metabolic economy has begun.

## 🤲 Humanitarian Support (Reimagined)

An aid agency observes the thriving local trade and decides to **support the system** rather than override it.

### Two Options:
1. **Infrastructure Investment**: Buy assets (e.g., boreholes, mills) that expand productive capacity—enabling **more commitments** and **larger pools**.
2. **CAV Prepurchase**: Buy BIGIs and MBELEs from the groups (like CVA), and redistribute to vulnerable households—**routing dignity through redemption**.

This support creates **local multiplier effects** rather than extraction. Vouchers circulate multiple times before being redeemed, and every redemption is a **fulfilled promise**, not a sale.

> “Instead of aid leaving the community in one transaction, it bounces—amplifying trust.”

## 🪴 Lessons from Binguni and Mbele

- A community’s **lack of money** is not a lack of value—it’s a **lack of memory and coordination**.
- **Commitment Pooling** restores that memory by recording, authenticating, and routing promises.
- **CAVs** are not currency—they’re metabolic trust tokens.

This is not a market. It is a living system of care, craft, and commitment.
