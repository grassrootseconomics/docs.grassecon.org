# Charter

## Vision

We see a world where communities are in control of their own financial instruments as an essential ingredient for economic liberty and empowerment.


## Mission

Demonstrate, design, disseminate & curate the best tech and practices to empower communities to create and manage their own financial instruments. We offer a collection of documents and tools to create community inclusion currencies, and to enable interactions between any community created currency and various technologies. This documentation enables people to choose and implement software that is flexible to meet their needs and comprehension. Communities can use these tools to develop assignable credit obligations on different ledger technologies and networks. In turn, they use these tools and networks to create their own applications and services that provide, connect, serve and protect the currencies they have created.

## How

* Identify and define concepts that are common across the bulk of existing cryptocurrency and community currency methods and technologies
* Turn these concepts into low-cost, highly available, documentation and blockchain agnostic tooling for CIC creation
* Contribute to node infrastructure that can be run on any devices, especially low-end ones
* Counteract centralization of blockchain node infrastructure by making nodes as localized as possible
* Treat technology implementer as contributors not just consumers
* Reduce the cost of moving a currency systems between technologies
* Improve on the privacy properties of cash in digital currency transactions
* Create a global knowledge base of community currency implementations and best practices
* Ensure that any software services are not monopolized and that communities are empowered to run their own services

## Community Statement

This is an open group that identifies key roles that make up the community: software engineers, practitioners, community groups, field & support engineers, designers and artists, system administrators, web designers, writers, speakers, translators, volunteers and more. Organizations such as Grassroots Economics Foundation identify employees and community bounty programs to support these efforts based on available funding from grants. Community members are extremely important - your input and support is needed to make these tools useful.
