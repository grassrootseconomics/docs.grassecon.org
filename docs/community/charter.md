# Grassroots Economics Foundation Charter

---

## Introduction

This is a **charter and practical guide** for those cultivating new pathways of economic coordination—pathways rooted in **trust**, **reciprocity**, **resource sharing**, and **community memory**.

At the heart of this work is **commitment pooling**: not a new invention, but a **recognition of living coordination patterns** already woven into traditional, ecological, and relational systems. These pools function as **metabolic trust systems**—vessels of promises and collective memory that help communities organize care and value beyond the confines of extractive markets or centralized institutions.

From **ancestral seed-sharing** to **mycorrhizal nutrient networks**, commitment pooling mirrors the way life has always coordinated.

This charter offers 16 strategic principles for regenerating economies through **shared memory** and **shared responsibility**. Each principle is a seed—rooted in movement-building, relational ethics, and regenerative protocol design. They are meant to support local stewards as they grow this paradigm within trust-rich communities and then propagate it outward.

> It is a call to remember:  
> That value can be coordinated through mutual care.  
> That economies can emerge from relationships.  
> That resilience is grown—not imposed—through shared intention, humility, and joy.

## What Is Commitment Pooling?

### A Relational System of Care and Credit

Commitment pooling is a **protocol** where value flows through **promises, reciprocity, and shared memory**. It allows communities to coordinate **labor, time, resources, and care** based on trust rather than transaction.

It tracks commitments: who has offered what, and how that care circulates. These commitments may be held in verbal agreements, local ledgers, or digital tools—but the protocol is not new.

> It is not invented, it is remembered.

Commitment pooling echoes:
- What fungi do beneath the forest floor,  
- What grandparents do across generations,  
- What communities do in times of need.  

It is a **living system of coordination**—emerging from ecological rhythms of exchange, ancestral protocols of shared responsibility, and the cultural logic of *“we belong to each other.”*

In its essence, commitment pooling is **not a financial tool**. It is a **pattern of relational stewardship**.  
It is a **metabolism of trust**—where every promise is part of a larger story, and every fulfillment nourishes the commons.

## Vision

We envision a world where communities coordinate value through trust, shared memory, and mutual care—where economic life is rooted in relationship, reciprocity, and belonging.

---

## 🛠 Mission

Demonstrate, design, disseminate & curate the best **technologies and practices** to empower communities to create and manage their own economic agreements.

We offer tools and documentation to enable communities to:
- Create **Commons**
- Enable interactions between **Community Asset Vouchers**, **Commitment Pools**, and **technologies**
- Implement systems that are **flexible**, **comprehensible**, and **locally appropriate**

---

## How We Work

- Identify and define shared concepts across technologies, commitment economies, and resource coordination
- Translate these into **low-cost**, **modular**, **technology-agnostic** documentation and tooling
- Contribute to infrastructure usable on **any device**, especially low-end/offline-capable
- Prioritize **local implementation** and **decentralized stewardship**
- Support implementers as **contributors**, not just consumers
- Ensure smooth migration of financial instruments between systems
- Improve privacy properties akin to **cash-like bearer instruments**
- Build a global, open-source **knowledge base** of Commons
- Avoid monopolization of services; empower communities to **self-host and self-govern**

## Principles for Spreading Commitment Pooling

1. **Honor the Existing Systems, Even as You Outgrow Them**  
   Acknowledge the real problems centralized systems tried to solve. We’re not here to attack; we’re here to invite.

2. **Seed a Strategy with Deep Time in Mind**  
   Think in cycles of 7, 70, or 700 years. Build protocols meant to last longer than empires.

3. **Engage the Heart, Head, and Hands**  
   Speak to belonging, love, and care. Rituals and stories are essential infrastructure.

4. **This Is Ancient, Not New**  
   Pools are old as roots. Frame the work as restoration, not disruption.

5. **Start Where the Soil Is Ready**  
   Work with communities already reaching for each other. Trust-rich ground is fertile ground.

6. **Make Every Action Matter**  
   If it doesn’t grow trust or fulfill a promise, don’t do it.

7. **Use Simple, Resonant Frames**  
   “Your promise is your credit.” “Money is a memory of care.” Let clarity be louder than critique.

8. **Understand the Wounds of the Old System**  
   Translate commitment into safety and dignity.

9. **Offer a Vision That Feels Like Home**  
   Water catchments, shared kitchens, neighborhood pools. Show futures people can walk into.

10. **Speak in Many Media**  
    Radio, ritual, memes, murals. Redundancy is strength.

11. **Move Faster Than Extraction Can Respond**  
    Don’t wait for permission. Spread like mycelium—quiet, adaptive, strong.

12. **Celebrate Those Who Come Home**  
    Let those who leave exploitative systems return with dignity. Make it safe to rejoin the commons.

13. **Look at Crisis Without Falling into Collapse**  
    Build the pool now. Let it be ready when other systems falter.

14. **Give People Something to Do**  
    Define, seed, host, redeem, map, steward. When people act together, the future becomes real.

15. **Track What Matters**  
    Track fulfilled promises. Track mouths fed through trust. Let memory be your metric.

16. **Adapt Without Losing the Pattern**  
    Change tactics, not principles. Keep care, coordination, and coherence intact.

## Closing: Let the Pools Begin

**Commitment pooling is a field of care, not a system to be sold.**  
When we remember how to promise, how to track care together, and how to fulfill with joy—we are not designing economies. We are cultivating ecosystems.

**Your promise is enough.**  
You don’t need perfect tools or permission from institutions to start a pool. You just need a commitment—and someone to witness it. That’s where all healthy societies begin.

Let us seed trust where extraction once ruled.  
Let us tend memory where markets forgot.  
Let the pools begin—wherever you are.

> **The future of credit is not imposed. It is grown.**  
> **Let it begin with you.**
