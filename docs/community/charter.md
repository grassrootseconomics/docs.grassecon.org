# Charter

## Vision

We see a world where communities are in control of their own financial instruments as an essential ingredient for economic liberty and empowerment.


## Mission

Demonstrate, design, disseminate & curate the best tech and practices to empower communities to create and manage their own financial instruments. We offer a collection of documents and tools to create community inclusion currencies, and to enable interactions between any community created currency and various technologies. This documentation enables people to choose and implement software that is flexible to meet their needs and comprehension. Communities can use these tools to develop assignable credit obligations on different ledger technologies and networks. In turn, they use these tools and networks to create their own applications and services that provide, connect, serve and protect the currencies they have created.

## How

* Identify and define concepts that are common across the bulk of existing distributed ledger technology (DLT) and community currency methods and other technologies
* Turn these concepts into low-cost, highly available, modular documentation and technology agnostic tooling for financial instrument creation
* Contribute to node infrastructure that can be run on any devices, especially low-end ones
* Counteract centralization of DLT node infrastructure by making nodes as localized as possible
* Treat technology implementers as contributors not just consumers
* Reduce the cost of moving financial instruments and their accounts and other systems between technologies
* Improve on the privacy properties of cash like instruments in digital currency transactions
* Create a global knowledge base of community currency implementations and best practices
* Ensure that any software services are not monopolized and that communities are empowered to run their own services
