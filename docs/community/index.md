Community members are extremely important - your input and support is needed to make these tools useful and change the world.
Below are some key roles that make up the community:

1. **practitioners and community groups**: Are you working on or gettign started using a community currency? Hats off - you rock! Let's compare notes!

1. **system administrators, field & support engineers**: Are you maintaining, building, training community currencies? 
1. **educators, writers & speakers, content designers and artists**: People need to understand and own Economic Commons and their Instruments. We need so much help on content and getting the word out there that economic alternatives exists and work!
1. **translators**: This is all in English right now! HELP!
1. **researchers**: How do we know what we know? Please help us study the impacts of these programs and improve them!

Renumeration, bounties and rewards: Organizations such as [Grassroots Economics Foundation](https://grassecon.org) identify employees and community bounty programs to support these efforts based on available funding from grants. Note that this is a growing field and many organizations like the Red Cross have been and are seeking more and more people in this field because of the impacts they see on the ground. Changing the world's economic systems will not be *affordable* within the world's current economic system. So while traditiaonl national currency funding is sometimes avalaible, don't let that stop you from helping. People and organizations wanting to support these economic systems should interact with them themselves: Accept a CIC or create one redeemable for your own services and donate or exchange it to support this work.
