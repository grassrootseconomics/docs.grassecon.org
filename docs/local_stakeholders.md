# Working with Local Stakeholders

Before research in the community can be carried out, there is an essential need to engage the local government and essential stakeholders in the discussion about CICs. 


## Scenario analysis

In the example of Kenya, a village chief and DCC must always be alerted during the initial phase of Implementation.This is to be done before any community engagement can take place. This is to protect the community from fraudsters and ensure due diligence is done to protect the beneficiaries. Note that having a local Trainer of Trainers on board that knows the relevant authorities, customs and languages is wonderful to work with and assist in any meetings.

A brief introduction is given to relevant persons after an official letter is sent out to their offices asking for an audience (see below). 

This list below are people who should be engaged during the preparedness phase, communities respond better to new interventions when the following people are on board: 



1. Village chief
2. Village administrators
3. Village Elders 
4. District County Commissioner
5. Local religious leaders
6. Community leaders
7. Area MPs
8. Governors 
9. Local businesses owners 
10. Local Industries 
11. Local Trade unions 
12. Suppliers and vendors
13. Other Humanitarian Organizations
14. County Government 
15. Chairpersons of local community groups 
16. Local activists 
17. Civil society groups 
18. Community Based Organizations
19. Faith Based Organizations
20. Womenâ€™s Representative

Vulnerable groups in the community should be identified with the help of local stakeholders. This group is necessary for CVA and other humanitarian programs.

Dear Sir/ Madam,

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Re: Community Inclusion Currencies</span>**

This Implementing Agency, with the assistance of county governments and other local stakeholders such as, Mosques, Churches, community chamas, schools, and individuals alike are working to create healthy and sustainable communities in the face of hard economic conditions. 

Community Inclusion Currencies (CICs) can be described as vouchers created by local groups and organizations that can be used to **support vulnerable households** in communities. During times of crisis it helps communities support each other and maintain continued trade regardless of whether or not an individual can access local currency. 

In general, the CIC program aims to empower communities to take on the responsibility for their own financial well-being and economic growth. The purpose of the training is to help communities understand the benefits and obligations of being part of the network. For instance, Community Inclusion Currencies (CICs) are a means to launch community projects, jump-start or bolster local economies, boost financial inclusion and to foster independence and sustainability of vulnerable communities. 

CICs are easy to use and open to everyone as a means of offering their support to the local community by providing their goods and services for barter trade. To enroll you simply dial *384*96# on your phone line. 

It is in this regard that we write to your esteemed office requesting for a time to meet and ultimately authorization to continue with the implementation of community inclusion currency within District and its environs. 

Thank you and we look forward to your support.

Kind regards,
