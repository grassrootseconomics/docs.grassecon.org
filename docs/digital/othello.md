#  Staking with Othello Wallet

### 1. Setup Othello Wallet

Visit [Othello Wallet](https://celowallet.app/setup) website. You can alternatively install a Desktop version (Recommended) by  clicking on the "Download for Desktop" on the bottom of the webiste.

### 2. Choose a Login Option

#### Create a New Account

If you choose “Create New Account”, you can see your public address and mnemonic word phrase as in the screenshot. Copy your mnemonic word phrase and keep it safe. Click the continue button to go on.

Set your password with at least one capital letter. Enter your password again in “Confirm Password” blank. Just as the mnemonic word phrase, you must keep your password safe. Click the “Set Password” button to continue.

If you saw this pop-up screen, click the “I Understand” button unless you miss anything. Now, you finish making the new account! You can enter your account and check it in [Celo explorer](https://celoscan.io).

#### Use an Existing Account

There are two options to log in to the wallet using an existing account. We will use the “Use Account Key” option in this guide. If you want to login with Ledger, try this Link.

Enter your mnemonic word phrase in the blank. Then, click the “Import Account” button.

Enter your password twice and click the “Set Password” button.

You will see the pop-up screen as above. Click the “I Understand” button and you can log in to the wallet.

### 3. Lock CELO

**To stake CELO, you should lock CELO, vote for a validator group, and activate your votes in sequence.**

Click the “More” button and you will see 6 tabs including “Lock” and “Stake” buttons. Click on the “Lock” first.

Enter the amount of CELO you want to lock. Remember that you must leave some CELO to pay for the fee. You could vote for a validator group or governance proposals. Press the “Continue” button if you decide how much CELO you want to lock.

You should wait for about a minute to finish locking CELO. When it’s completed, you will see the pop-up screen that indicates your lock request was successful.

### 4. Vote for Grassroots Economics

You can check the changes to your account on the left. If there’s no problem, click the “More” button again, and press the “Stake” tab. Then, the validators list will show up.

Find **GrassrootsEconomics** and click it. Addresses and “Vote for Group” button will appear. Click the button.

Enter the amount of Celo you want to vote. Also, we remind you that you should leave some Celo to pay for the fee. Click the “Continue” button to go on.

Check your value for staking and the fee. Click the “Vote” button when everything is alright.

### 5. Activate your votes

**This step can only be completed 24 hrs after voting for GrassrootsEconomics**

When you access the Celo Wallet 24 hours later, you will see the pop-up screen that informs you to activate your votes. Click the “Activate” button.

Confirm your votes are correct. Continue if there’s anything wrong.

Check your votes once again. Press the “Activate” button to finish the staking.

Now, you’ve completed all steps for the staking. Staking rewards will be automatically paid once a day.
