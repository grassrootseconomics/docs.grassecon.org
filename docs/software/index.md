# CIC Software

## Technology Setup

Generally the technical setup is done by a local Platform Service Provider like Grassroots Economics. The more local the better.

1. **Open Source (CopyLeft) Software**: Ensure that you trust the software being used and that even if it is open source now, that improvements and upgrades will remain open source. Check out our [stack](/software/).
1. **Distributed Ledger**: We highly recommend developing your own ledger system where members of the community hold nodes that decentralize and secure the ledger.
1. **Interfaces / Wallets**: Weâ€™ve built custodial systems that enable users to assign guardians that can help them reset lost passwords.
1. **Data Sharing**: Given the consent of the community, anonymous transaction data can be recorded and displayed


## CIC Stack Summary

While work toward *non-custodial* and web interfaces are underway, the CIC Stack is currently a *custodial* wallet and blockchain bidirectional interface engine for community inclusion currencies

- Fully Open source GPL 3.0 License
- Automates the full lifecycle of blockchain transactions
- Chain agnostic by design
- Introduces a new chain library toolset written from scratch
- Modular design with fully standalone but recombinable components
- Includes a broad collection CLI tools for most common chain and engine operations
- Empowers implementers to choose their level of abstraction
- Supports both local, containerized and decentralized environments
- Support last mile front-end apis and integrations

## System parts

- **Base components**, containing all necessary provisions for services and tooling. ([Chaintools](https://gitlab.com/chaintool))
- **Generic services components**, libraries, daemons and services making up the custodial engine. ([cicnet](https://gitlab.com/chaintool))
- **Deployment components**, which facilitates deployment of the custodial engine, as well as seeding data for development, demonstration and migration. ([GrassrootsEconomics](https://gitlab.com/grassrootseconomics/))


## Base components

- **Queue handling** ([chainqueue](https://gitlab.com/chaintool/chainqueue)): Makes sure that a transaction sent on behalf of a user is sent, resubmitted if stalled, and whose execution is verified by querying the network state.
- **Chain syncing**, ([chainsyncer](https://gitlab.com/chaintool/chainsyncer)): Retrieves all state changes from the network and executes an arbitrary number of code fragments per transaction.
- **RPC (Remote Procedure Call) interface**, which divides in two parts:
	1. **Generic interface** ([chainlib](https://gitlab.com/chaintool/chainlib)): Concepts common to all chain-like RPCs, and provides a thread-safe interaction framework.
	1. **Ethereum interface** ([chainlib-eth](https://gitlab.com/chaintool/chainlib-eth)): An extension of the former for the Ethereum/EVM network.
- **Chain tooling** ([chainlib](https://gitlab.com/chaintool/chainlib), [chainlib-eth](https://gitlab.com/chaintool/chainlib-eth)): Granular access to all conceptual layers of chain interaction, including binary serializations and application interfaces, along with CLI (Command Line Interface) tooling framework.
- **Signer**, ([crypto-dev-signer](https://gitlab.com/chaintool/crypto-dev-signer)) Low-security keystore and signer which is easily usable in both production (provided that no external access is possible) and in any development environment.
- **Configuration** ([confini](https://gitlab.com/nolash/python-confini)): Incrementally merging configuration definition from multiple modules, and easily overriding them with command line flags and environment variables.


### Generic services components

- All smart contract wrappers in the [cicnet](https://gitlab.com/cicnet) repository.
- **CIC Contract registry** ([cic-eth-registry](https://gitlab.com/grassrootseconomics/cic-eth-registry)): Defines token and resource pointer lookup and authentication resources.
- Daemons and microservices in the **apps** subdirectories in the [cic-internal-integration](https://gitlab.com/grassrootseconomics/cic-internal-integration) monorepo, specifically:
	* **cic-eth**: Massively parallel and fault-tolerant implementation of the custodial signer/queuer/syncer engine, accepting tasks from end-users via middleware.
	* **cic-cache**: Cache syncer and database fetching and storing details on transactions of interest.
	* **cic-ussd**: State machine, microservices and gateway for end-users using the USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) interface via telcos.
	* **cic-notify**: Pluggable notification engine, initially used only for SMS notifications to end-users.

### Deployment components

- Data seeding and/or migrations for new development deployments. Located in the **apps/data-seeding** subdirectory of [cic-internal-integration](https://gitlab.com/grassrootseconomics/cic-internal-integration).
- Deployment and initialization of network resources (smart contracts etc) and initialization of the custodial engine. Located in the **apps/contract-migrations** subdirectory of [cic-internal-integration](https://gitlab.com/grassrootseconomics/cic-internal-integration).
