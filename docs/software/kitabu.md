# Kitabu Chain

## About Kitabu Chain

The Kitabu (Meaning 'Ledger or Book' in Kiswahili) Blockchain is derived from Open Ethereum and Aura Consensus and learnings from BloxBerg.org by Grassroots Economics Foundation to enable decentralized ledger services to reach vulnerable and marginalized communities. It is a key part of Sarafu Network and the Grassroots Economic Commons which enable people and organizations to create and utilize Instruments.

## Technology

1. Kitabu chain is a proof of authority chain and utilizes Open Ethereum and the [Aura Consensus](https://openethereum.github.io/Aura).
1. The open source code for Kitabu Chain as well as instructions to run a node can be found on [gitLab](https://gitlab.com/grassrootseconomics/kitabu-chain)

## Economics:
1. Genesis block: 129,600,000 [Vouchers](/legal/license/#instruments) called Ukurasa (symbol: UKU) (aka "page" in Kiswahili) will be created and redeemable as payment for 1 transaction on the Kitbu Chain.
    1. These UTU equal to an estimated transaction capacity of 50 transactions per second for 12 months at an median price of 1 gwei per transaction. (50x60x60x24x12x1 gwei = 129,600,000 UKU will be created).
    1. Ukurasa (UKU) are Vouchers (CICs) redeemable as payment to Validators for writing or executing any contract on the Kitabu Chain.
    1. UKU are given to Validators as rewards for validating blocks / transactions. They also prevent abuse of the Kitabu Chain.
    1. UKU have no expiration date.
1. Community Fund: UKU Vouchers are intially created in a community fund and freely distributed to users when they initally register an account or when they run out of UKU from doing transactions. Existing users from previous Sarafu-Network chains will be imported with 5 UKU
    1. Swap agreement: UKU - SRF: When there is less than one month's worth of (50x60x60x24x1x1 gwei= 4,320,000 UKU) UKU in the Community Fund to support the interactions of users on Kitabu Chain - Grassroots Economics Foundation will purchase UKU from Validators evenly at a rate of 1 Sarafu = 100 UKU based on avalaible [Sarafu](/legal/agreement/#instruments) in the Grassroots Economics Community Fund.

## Validators
1. Voting: Any changes to Kitabu chain, such as but not limited to, validator addition or removal are voted on by existing Validators.
    1. 1 Validator = 1 vote.
    1. Quorum must reach 50% of all validators and for a vote to pass 90% of the voting Validators must agree.
    1. Voting will take place on the Grassroots Economics [chat server](https://chat.grassrootseconomics.net). 
    1. Grassroots Economics Foundation will be the Chair of the quorum and enact decisions created. Voting for validators will eventually (by 2023) be automated as a contract on Kitabu Chain.
    1. No single organization including Grassroots Economics Foundation shall control or have interests or power over more than 45% of the validation nodes.
1. All validators as well as users of Kitabu chain agree to the [Grassroots Economics Commons Agreement](/legal/agreement/) as Members.
1. All validators agree to our [Code of Conduct](/community/conduct/).
1. All validators agree to keep their validation node(s) put an running 90% of the time with a minimum system requirement of: 1vCPU, 2GB Ram, 25 GB Storage and an internet connection.
