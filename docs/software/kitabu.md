# Kitabu Chain

## About Kitabu Chain

The Kitabu (Meaning Ledger or Book in Kiswahili) Blockchain was developed by Grassroots Economics Foundation to enable ledger services to reach vulnerable and marginalized communities. It is a key part of Sarafu Network and the Grassroots Economic Commons which enable people and organizations to create and utilize Instruments.

## Key elements:
1. Genisis block: The inital amount of a native gas token called Ukurasa (UKU) (page in Kiswahili) will be created equal to an estimated transaction capacity of 50 transactions per second for 12 months at an median price of 1 gwei per transaction. (50x60x60x24x12x1 gwei = 129,600,000 UKU will be created).
1. Ukurasa (UKU) are Vouchers (CIC) and redeemable as payment to Validators for writing or executing any contract on the Kitabu Chain. UTU are given to Validators as rewards for validating blocks.
1. Community Fund: UKU tokens are intially created in a community fund and freely distributed to users via a faucet when they initally register an account or when they run out of UKU from doing transactions. Existing users from previous Sarafu-Network chains will be imported with 5 UKU
    1. If or when there is not enough UTU to in the community fund the interactions of existing users.
1. All validators as well as users of Kitabu chain agree to the [Grassroots Economics Commons Agreement](/legal/agreement/) as Members.
1. Voting: Any changes to Kitabu chain, such as but not limited to, validator addition or removal are voted on by existing Validators.
    1. 1 Validator = 1 vote.
    1. Quorum must reach 50% of all validators and and for a vote to pass 90% of the voting Validators must agree.
    1. Voting will take place on the Grassroots Economics [chat server](https://chat.grassrootseconomics.net). 
    1. Grassroots Economics Foundation will be the Chair of the quorum and enact decisions created. Voting for validators will eventually (by 2023) be automated as a contract on Kitabu Chain.
1. No single organization including Grassroots Economics Foundation shall control or have interests or power over more than 45% of the validation nodes.
