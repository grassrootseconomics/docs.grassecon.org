# **Public Awareness & Transparent Heritage (PATH v0.1) License**

Version 0.1 August 21st 2023

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

## Preamble:

In the spirit of knowledge sharing, this license aims to encourage transparency, equity, and community-centered practices in the distribution and exchange of all offerings, be they tangible goods, services, software, or intangible assets. By adhering to this license, entities affirm their commitment to public awareness and uphold the ideals of a transparent heritage.

The Public Awareness & Transparent Heritage (PATH) License is a free license for offerings, be they tangible goods, services, software, or intangible assets. It is specifically designed to promote transparency, equity, and community-centered practices in their distribution and exchange.

Many licenses for offerings are crafted to restrict your ability to share and adapt them. In contrast, the PATH License aims to ensure your freedom to share, adapt, and understand all versions of an offering, ensuring it remains accessible and transparent for all its recipients.

When we mention "free" in the context of this license, we refer to freedom of use and understanding, not cost. The PATH License ensures that you can distribute copies of offerings (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive Comprehensive Insight (CI) into the offering, and that you can adapt or use parts of it in new offerings, knowing you have the rights to do so.

Providers using the PATH License safeguard your rights by: (1) asserting rights over the offering, and (2) granting you this License, which provides legal permission to copy, distribute, and/or modify the offering.

A notable advantage of this approach is that enhancements made in alternate versions of an offering, if they gain traction, become available for other providers to integrate. Many providers are motivated by the resulting collaboration. However, for offerings like software used on network servers, this collaborative spirit might not always manifest. The PATH License ensures that in such scenarios, any modifications made are transparently available to the community. It mandates that operators of such offerings provide Comprehensive Insight into any modified version being used.

The PATH License is inspired by previous licenses that aimed to achieve similar transparency and community-focused goals such as AGPL3.0. The specific terms and conditions for copying, distribution, and modification are detailed in the following sections.

## Terms and Conditions

1. **Definitions**:

    1. "Offering" encompasses any goods, services, software, intangible assets, or other entities that are sold, given, exchanged, or to which access is granted.
    2. "Provider" refers to any distributor, reseller, or entity that offers access to an offering, or any derivative or modified version of it.
    3. "Recipient" denotes any individual, group, or entity that receives, acquires, or is granted access to the offering, whether through purchase, exchange, gift, or any other means.

2. **Full Disclosure**: When distributing or granting access to an offering, providers shall present recipients with exhaustive information vital for a holistic comprehension of said offering. If the nature of the offering allows, mechanisms must be instituted to facilitate access and potential modifications. This obligation is unceasing.

2. **Transparency of Alterations**: Any divergences or subsequent changes from the original state of the offering must be candidly revealed by providers.

3. **Reciprocal Transparency Responsibility**: Recipients, in leveraging the offering, are duty-bound to maintain the essence of these guidelines. This involves ensuring visibility for any alterations, derivatives, or re-distributions they might engage in. This continuous obligation, akin to a "share alike" ethos, mandates proper acknowledgment of sources.

4. **Engagements with External Offerings**: In instances where the offering is integrated with another outside the purview of this license, provisions of this license persist for the original offering, retaining its accessibility and modifiability.

5. **Supportive Documentation**: Providers must supply any auxiliary resources or explanations that are crucial for the user's effective engagement with the offering. This includes understanding, using, or potentially altering the offering.

6. **Parallel Freedom Provision**: Should there arise a scenario where the offering's redistribution curtails customary access or adaptability, an obligation rests upon providers to concurrently offer an unfettered version.

7. **Infringements and Repercussions**: Undertakings that sidestep, subvert, or are in contradiction to this license's tenets render the action non-binding. Such infractions could lead to the temporary or permanent rescinding of the rights bestowed by this license upon the offender.

8. **Rights Assurance**: This license is not in contravention of and does not diminish any entitlements that recipients might hold under applicable copyright laws, other relevant regulations, or patent or trademark obligations.

9. **Conveyance of Duties and Privileges**: It falls upon providers to unambiguously relay the responsibilities and advantages intrinsic to this license when distributing or granting access, thus empowering recipients with a lucid grasp of their entitlements and commitments.

10. **Disclaimer of Warranty and Limitation of Liability**: The offering is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. In no event shall the provider be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the offering or the use or other dealings in the offering.

11. **Versioning and Updates**: This license may be updated or revised in the future. Each version will be distinguished by a unique version number. When an offering is distributed or accessed under a specific version of this license, it will remain under that version's terms unless explicitly updated to a newer version by the provider.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

## How to Apply These Terms

If you develop a new offering, whether it's a program, service, tangible good, or intangible asset, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it available under the terms of the Public Awareness & Transparent Heritage (PATH) License. This ensures transparency, equity, and community-centered practices in its distribution and exchange.

To do so, attach the following notices to the offering. If it's a software program, it is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
   
> one line to give the offering's name and a brief idea of what it does.
> Copyright (C) (year) (name of author)

> This offering is made available under the terms of the Public Awareness & Transparent Heritage (PATH) License v0.1.

> This offering is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the PATH License for more details.

> You should have received a copy of the Public Awareness & Transparent Heritage (PATH) License v0.1 along with this offering. If not, see https://docs.grassecon.org/commons/path

Also add information on how to contact you.

If your offering of software or service can interact with users remotely through a computer network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to get its details and source, if applicable. For example, if your offering is a web application, its interface could display a "Details" or "Source" link that leads users to an archive or description of the offering. There are many ways you could offer details, and different solutions will be better for different offerings; refer to the specific requirements of the PATH License.
