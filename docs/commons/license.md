### **Instruments**

The Instruments of an Economic Commons include:


1. **Token (Unilateral Instrument)** - a real or virtual object (fungible or non fungible) that may be accepted by another Member in exchange for value at their complete discretion. 
    (There is no obligation to accept a Token nor is there any obligation to redeem a Token by the issuer. Tokens may represent collectible endorsed data such as Voucher usage.) 

2. **Voucher (Bilateral Instrument)** – a promise denominated in an agreed upon Unit of Account issued and accepted in exchange for money or in-kind and representing an assignable credit obligation of the issuer. 
 
    The following are properties of Vouchers: 

    1. If the acceptor/final holder of the voucher presents it in payment to the issuer, for goods or services supplied, it must be accepted in payment.
    2. Unit of Account: Standard unit of measure for value in exchange. Each Voucher on the Platform issued by a Member should specify a Unit of Account.
        1. Example: 1000 SRF Vouchers can be said to be redeemable by the Issuing Member for 1000 Kenyan Shillings worth of the issuer’s services.)
    3. Expiry Date or Rate: Each Voucher on the Platform issued by a Member should specify no expiration, an expiry date or a gradual expiration rate over time. Expired Vouchers will automatically be placed in a Community Account.
        2. Example: An gradual expiration rate of 2% a month will mean that any outstanding Voucher balances will automatically be reduced by 2% a month and placed in the designated Community Account.
    4. No redemption for national currency: the Issuer shall not redeem Vouchers for National Currency and bears full sole responsibility for their issuance, assignment and redemption in goods and/or services.
    
3. **Swap (Multilateral Instrument)** – a production and risk sharing agreement over time. 
    5. e.g. A Swap may entitle a group of Members to share in the revenue or production from land usage over a period of time. Vouchers or Tokens based on flows of land use revenue or production are allocated proportionally between the accounts of Members.
    6. e.g. A Swap may entitle a provider of a Instrument in exchange for another Instrument to receive a share of the exchange volume.
