# Stewarded Pools for Relational Obligations and Unified Trust (SPROUT) License 
**Version 1.0 â€“ May 19 2025**  
**Â© 2025 Grassroots Economics Foundation **  
This license governs the creation, operation, and federation of digital Commitment Pools.

---

## Preamble

This license affirms that commitment pools are living commons â€” not markets. They are tools for mutual aid, peer-trust, and voluntary reciprocity rooted in care, not commerce. By creating a pool under this license, you affirm that the pool will not be used for wage replacement, speculation, or hidden monetization of service labor.

---

## License Affirmations

By adopting SPROUT, you affirm:

- The pool is **not a business**.
- **Participation is voluntary** and peer-curated.
- **Commitments are symbolic**, not contractual debts.
- The pool is a **commons of care**, not a vending machine or payroll tool.

## Core Principles

1. **Care, Not Commerce** â€” Pools circulate trust, not money.
2. **Voluntary Exchange** â€” No coercion; no contracts.
3. **Transparent Tracking** â€” Every swap is borrowing with visible purpose.
4. **No Wage Substitution** â€” Pools arenâ€™t payrolls.
5. **Peer Curation** â€” Only trusted, known members issue vouchers.
6. **Commitments, Not IOUs** â€” Vouchers are symbolic promissory tokens.
7. **No Fiat Cash-Outs** â€” Pools do not act as bridges to fiat/cash.
8. **Endowments Are Gifts** â€” All resource seeding is donation or endowment, not investment.
9. **Federated Integrity** â€” Federated pools honor each otherâ€™s local governance.

## Responsibilities of Pool Creators

- Maintain a **written Pool Charter** avalaible to all members.
- Document swaps and redemptions on a **public ledger**.
- Make **pool logic, voucher definitions, and roles** visible.
- Track all assets and commitments with **clear provenance**.
- Prevent **anonymous market access** or speculation.
- Use tools like Sarafu.Network aligned with these principles.

---

## Violations

License may be **revoked** by Grassroots Economics Foudnation if pool is found to:

- Simulate or disguise employment.
- Misrepresent redeemable value or cause deception.
- Enable anonymous speculation or voucher dumping.
- Bypass consent of federated pools or protocols.

In such cases, stewards may flag the pool for re-audit, suspend federated links, and request public remediation.
