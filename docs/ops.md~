# Introduction to Grassroots Economics Documentation

Grassroots Economics is a non-profit foundation that seeks to empower marginalized communities to take charge of their own livelihoods and economic future. We focus on community development through economic empowerment, basic income and Community Inclusion Currency (CIC) programs.

We see a world where communities are in control of their own currency technology as an essential ingredient for economic liberty and empowerment.

Grassroots Economics is dedicated to helping communities realize and share their abundance. 

While core beneficiaries of our programs include small businesses and people living in informal settlements as well as rural areas, the documentation and tools have been broadly applied worldwide.

For the Grassroots Economics website visit [grassrootseconomics.org](https://www.grassrootseconomics.org).

It is tremendously important to us that people take, use, build on and share what we've found to be useful. This documentation site is a collection of the various learnings and tools we've helped build and use over the years.

These documents are broken down into:

* Operational Documentation:
  * Learn how to work with and empower communities to develop their own CICs
  * Learn how people and organizations can form Clearning Unions together and share their abundance using legal instruments.
* Software Documentation:
  * Join a community of developers working to build the CIC Stack
  * Become a technical service provider and help communities develop their own financial instruments.




## Mission

Here we offer a collection of documents and tools to create community inclusion currencies, and to enable interactions between any community created currency and various technologies. This documentation enables people to choose and implement software that is flexible to meet their needs and comprehension. Communities can use these tools to develop assignable credit oblications on different ledger technologies and networks. In turn, they use these tools and networks to create their own applications and services that provide, connect, serve and protect the currencies they have created.

## How

* Identify and define concepts that are common across the bulk of existing cryptocurrency and community currency methods and technologies
* Turn these concepts into low-cost, highly available, docuentation and blockchain agnostic tooling for CIC creation
* Contribute to node infrastructure that can be run on any devices, especially low-end ones
* Counteract centralization of blockchain node infrastructure by making nodes as localized as possible
* Treat technology implementers as contributors not just consumers
* Reduce the cost of moving a currency systems between technologies
* Improve on the privacy properties of cash in digital currency transactions
* Create a global knowledge base of community currency implementations and best practices
* Ensure that any software services are not monopolized and that communities are empowered to run their own services

## Community Statment

The CIC Commons is an open group that identifies key roles that make up the community: software engineers, practitioners, community groups, field & support engineers, designers and artists, system administrators, web designers, writers, speakers, translators, volunteers and more. Organizations such as Grassroots Economics Foundation identify employees and community bounty programs to support these efforts based on avalible funding from grants. Community members are extreemly important - your input and support is needed to make these tools useful.
