# Introduction to CIC Stack 

For the Grassroots Economics website visit [grassrootseconomics.org](https://www.grassrootseconomics.org).

## Mission

The CIC Commons presents a collection of tools to create community inclusion currencies, and to enable interactions between any community created currency and various technologies. The CIC Commons enables people to choose and implement software that is flexible to meet their needs and comprehension. Communities can use these tools to develop assignable credit oblications on different ledger technologies and networks. In turn, they use these tools and networks to create their own applications and services that provide, connect, serve and protect the currencies they have created.

## Vision

The Community Inclusion Currency (CIC) Tech Commons sees a world where communities are in control of their own currency technology as an essential ingredient for economic liberty and empowerment.

Grassroots Economics is dedicated to helping communities realize and share their abundance. 

## How

* Identify and define concepts that are common across the bulk of existing cryptocurrency and community currency technologies
* Turn these concepts into low-cost, highly available, blockchain agnostic tooling for CIC creation
* Contribute to node infrastructure that can be run on any devices, especially low-end ones
* Counteract centralization of blockchain node infrastructure by making nodes as localized as possible
* Treat technology implementers as contributors not just consumers
* Reduce the cost of moving a currency systems between technologies
* Improve on the privacy properties of cash in digital currency transactions
* Create a global knowledge base of community currency implementations and best practices
* Ensure that any software services are not monopolized and that communities are empowered to run their own services

## Community Statment

The CIC Commons is an open group that identifies key roles that make up the community: software engineers, practitioners, community groups, field & support engineers, designers and artists, system administrators, web designers, writers, speakers, translators, volunteers and more.Organizations such as Grassroots Economics Foundation identify employees and community bounty programs to support the CIC Commons based on avalible funding from grants. Community members are extreemly important to the CIC commons as they are the commons - your input and support is needed to make these tools useful.

## Our Responsibilities
