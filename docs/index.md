# Karibu to Grassroots Economics' Docs

Grassroots Economics is a non-profit foundation that seeks to empower marginalized communities to take charge of their own livelihoods and economic future. We focus on community development through economic empowerment and are dedicated to helping communities realize and share their abundance. While core beneficiaries of our programs include small businesses and people living in informal settlements as well as rural areas, the documentation and tools have been broadly applied worldwide. For the Grassroots Economics website visit [grassrootseconomics.org](https://www.grassrootseconomics.org).
