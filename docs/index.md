# Introduction to Grassroots Economics' Documentation

Grassroots Economics is a non-profit foundation that seeks to empower marginalized communities to take charge of their own livelihoods and economic future. We focus on community development through economic empowerment and are dedicated to helping communities realize and share their abundance. While core beneficiaries of our programs include small businesses and people living in informal settlements as well as rural areas, the documentation and tools have been broadly applied worldwide. For the Grassroots Economics website visit [grassrootseconomics.org](https://www.grassrootseconomics.org).

It is tremendously important to us that people take, use, build on and share what we've found to be useful. This collaborative documentation site is a work in progress and an evolving collection of the various learnings and tools and broken into:
