2. Care for land - minimise use of finite resources for economic activity.
3. Equity - affordable and secure access to land, resources, knowledge & care.

8. Resilience - prepare for economic, political, climate and other shocks


## 3/ Jurisdiction

The Community Inclusion Collective (S-CICo) Agreement, as an associative and participative agreement, transcends jurisdiction and is tax transparent.

All Members are bound by local law generally and tax laws specifically. Any usage of Instruments are between willing Members who must satisfy themselves that all trades are locally lawful.


## 4/ Definitions 


### Instruments 

Community Inclusion Currencies include any of the following defined Instruments:



1. **Voucher (Bilateral agreement)** – a promise denominated in an agreed upon Unit of Account issued and accepted in exchange for money or in-kind and representing an assignable credit obligation of the issuer. 

    (If the acceptor/final holder of the voucher presents it in payment to the issuer, for goods or services supplied, it must be accepted in payment.)


    **Vouchers**  herein called **Sarafu** are assignable credit obligations issued by a provider of goods and services in exchange for value received from an acceptor and are redeemable or returnable by the ultimate acceptor in exchange for value provided by the issuer.


    **Unit of Account: **Standard unit of measure for value in exchange. Each Voucher on the Platform issued by a Member should specify a Unit of Account.


    (Example: 1000 SRF Vouchers can be said to be redeemable by the Issuing Member for 1000 Kenyan Shillings worth of the issuer’s services.)


    **No redemption for national currency:**  the Issuer shall not redeem Vouchers for National Currency and bears full sole responsibility for their Sarafu issuance, assignment and redemption in goods and/or services.

2. **Token (Unilateral agreement)** - a real or virtual object (fungible or non fungible) that may be accepted by another Member in exchange for value at their complete discretion. 

    (There is no obligation to accept a Token nor is there any obligation to redeem a Token by the issuer. Tokens may represent receipts for having supported a local community.)

3. **Swap (Multilateral agreement)** – a production and risk sharing agreement over time.

    (e.g. A Swap may entitle a group of Members to share in the revenue or production from land usage over a period of time. The sales of Tokens might be divided into the accounts of several Members.)
