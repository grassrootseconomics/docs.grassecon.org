## Addendum


#### Best Practice

While this agreement establishes the relationship with the applicant, and the Service provider - It is recommended that the Applicant Kibuyu have clear internal agreements and documentation on the following:



1. **Kibuyu cohesion: **Ensure your Kibuyu membership has a clear vision, aims & objectives and community statement.
2. **Needs assessment:** Identify and prioritise the pressing needs of the community.
3. **Partners:** Identify local stakeholders, partners and programs in alignment with the Kibuyu aims and objectives.
4. **Distribution**: Establish how the proceeds of Sarafu issuance will be used, including any fees or levies, distribution or loaning to members or group projects.
5. **Loans and Repayment:** If Sarafu are subject to redemption at a specified date or rate, there should be a clear productive purpose for the resulting debt, a repayment period and a clear mechanism including levies for non-performance. 
6. **Trade Balance: **Members should be required to accept as many Sarafu as they spend in a timely manner and be subject to levies. 
7. **Projects: **Any Kibuyu funded projects should be well planned and a designated manager put in charge. (E.g. Issuing Sarafu to fund community support for vulnerable households and community gardens.) 
8. **Cycles:** There should be a clearing cycle wherein all Sarafu are returned to the Applicant group account, credit obligations settled and a new Sarafu issuance made. If the Kibuyu is a chama this can match their loan funding cycles.
9. **Market/Meeting Days:** Regular meeting and/or market days (e.g. weekly) should be mandatory - where members meet to trade, discuss and compare Sarafu balances openly and attempt to reduce high balances and increase low balances. 
10. **Balance limits:** Members should have clear limits to how many Sarafu they hold for business purposes and should not accumulate excessive Sarafu reserves.
