## Jurisdiction

1. Any usage of Clearing Union Instruments are between willing Members who must satisfy themselves that all trades are locally lawful.
1. Members are subject to local identity laws and regulations in their respective jurisdiction.
1. Data may be shared internationally between Members in different jurisdictions.


## Definitions

### Instruments

The Instruments of an Economic Commons include:

1. **Token (Unilateral Instrument)** - a real or virtual object (fungible or non fungible) that may be accepted by another Member in exchange for value at their complete discretion.

    (There is no obligation to accept a Token nor is there any obligation to redeem a Token by the issuer. Tokens may represent receipts for having supported a local community.)

2. **Voucher (Bilateral Instrument)** – a promise denominated in an agreed upon Unit of Account issued and accepted in exchange for money or in-kind and representing an assignable credit obligation of the issuer.

    The following are properties of Vouchers:

    1. If the acceptor/final holder of the voucher presents it in payment to the issuer, for goods or services supplied, it must be accepted in payment.
    1. Unit of Account: Standard unit of measure for value in exchange. Each Voucher on the Platform issued by a Member should specify a Unit of Account.
        1. Example: 1000 SRF Vouchers can be said to be redeemable by the Issuing Member for 1000 Kenyan Shillings worth of the issuer’s services.)
    1. Expiry Date or Rate: Each Voucher on the Platform issued by a Member should specify no expiration, an expiry date or a gradual expiration rate over time. Expired Vouchers will automatically be placed in a Community Account.
        1. Example: An gradual expiration rate of 2% a month will mean that any outstanding Voucher balances will automatically be reduced by 2% a month and placed in the designated Community Account.
    1. No redemption for national currency: the Issuer shall not redeem Vouchers for National Currency and bears full sole responsibility for their issuance, assignment and redemption in goods and/or services.

3. **Swap (Multilateral Instrument)** – a production and risk sharing agreement over time.
    1. e.g. A Swap may entitle a group of Members to share in the revenue or production from land usage over a period of time. Vouchers or Tokens based on flows of land use revenue or production are allocated proportionally between the accounts of Members.
    2. e.g. A Swap may entitle a provider of a Voucher or Token in exchange for another to receive a share of the exchange volume.    

### Platform
