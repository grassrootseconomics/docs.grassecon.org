2. Validation Block Rewards (cUSD) are deposited into the liquidity pool (revolving fund) (With 2-3% APR for stakers)
3. The Liquidity Pool accepts the vouchers of Grassroots Economics accredited agroforestry communities. These CAVs are exchanged for cUSD in the pool.
4. Products from the community are verified and made available for purchase using the CAV vouchers. Digital verification data will be pushed to IPFS and certified by Environmental Expert driven certifications.
5. Anyone can exchange cUSD or Celo for CAVs to support communities and can also exchange the CAVs to receive products.
